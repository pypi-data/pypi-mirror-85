# Outputs a dataframe with score and rank columns

```
```python
from TOPSIS_AnmoldeepSingh_101983056 import rank_score_Topsis
# if output file name is provided,output file is saved in your current directory
Topsis_rank("input.csv","1,1,1,2","+,+,+,-","output.csv")
# Dataframe named output.csv will be saved in your current directory.
