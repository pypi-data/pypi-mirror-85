#String similarity using fuzzy matching
##How does it work?
It has all of the major algorithms for fuzzy matching: cosine similarity, levenchtein distance, and ngrams (bigrams support for other numbers coming soon). This package can also find the top match from a list of a query using an unweighted average.
##What can this be used for?
Well it can be used in applications where one needs to find the best match out of a list of names etc. Can even be used for txt files.
