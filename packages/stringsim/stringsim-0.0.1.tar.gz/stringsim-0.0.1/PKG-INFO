Description: #String similarity using fuzzy matching
        ##How does it work?
        It has all of the major algorithms for fuzzy matching: cosine similarity, levenchtein distance, and ngrams (bigrams support for other numbers coming soon). This package can also find the top match from a list of a query using an unweighted average.
        ##What can this be used for?
        Well it can be used in applications where one needs to find the best match out of a list of names etc. Can even be used for txt files.
