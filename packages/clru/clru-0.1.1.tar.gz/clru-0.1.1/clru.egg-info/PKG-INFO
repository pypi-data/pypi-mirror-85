        Sort subsections like so: Added, Bugfixes, Improvements, Technical tasks.
        Group anything an end user shouldn't care deeply about into technical
        tasks, even if they're technically bugs. Only include as "bugfixes"
        bugs with user-visible outcomes.
        
        When major components get significant changes worthy of mention, they
        can be described in a Major section.
