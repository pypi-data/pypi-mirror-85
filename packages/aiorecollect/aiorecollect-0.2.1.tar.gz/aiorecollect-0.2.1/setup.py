It\nallows users to programmatically retrieve schedules for waste removal in their area,\nincluding trash, recycling, compost, and more.\n\nSpecial thanks to @stealthhacker for the inspiration!\n\n# Installation\n\n```python\npip install aiorecollect\n```\n\n# Python Versions\n\n`aiorecollect` is currently supported on:\n\n* Python 3.7\n* Python 3.8\n* Python 3.9\n\n# Place and Service IDs\n\nTo use `aiorecollect`, you must know both your Recollect Place and Service IDs:\n\n1. In Chrome open developer tools and go to network tab.\n2. Go to your city\'s Recollect collection calendar.\n3. Search for and select your address in the UI.\n4. Watch for a request that looks like `https://api.recollect.net/api/places/(place_id)/services/(service_id)/events...`\n5. Use the place_id and service_id when instantiating a new `Client`.\n\n# Usage\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom datetime import date\n\nfrom aiorecollect import Client\n\n\nasync def main() -> None:\n    """Run."""\n    client = await Client("<PLACE ID>", "<SERVICE ID>")\n\n    # The client has a few attributes that you can access:\n    client.place_id\n    client.service_id\n\n    # Get all pickup events on the calendar:\n    pickup_results = await client.async_get_pickup_events()\n\n    # ...or get all pickup events within a certain date range:\n    pickup_results = await client.async_get_pickup_events(\n        start_date=date(2020, 10, 1), end_date=date(2020, 10, 31)\n    )\n\n    # ...or just get the next pickup event:\n    next_pickup = await client.async_get_next_pickup_event()\n\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n## The `PickupEvent` Object\n\nThe `PickupEvent` object that is returned from the above calls comes with three\nproperties:\n\n* `date`: a `datetime.date` that denotes the pickup date\n* `pickup_types`: a list of pickup types that will occur in this event\n* `area_name`: the name of the area in which the event is occurring\n\n## Connection Pooling\n\nBy default, the library creates a new connection to Recollect with each coroutine. If\nyou are calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every second\nof runtime savings possible), an\n[`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) `ClientSession` can be used for connection\npooling:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom aiohttp import ClientSession\n\nfrom aiorecollect import Client\n\n\nasync def main() -> None:\n    """Run."""\n    async with ClientSession() as session:\n        client = await Client("<PLACE ID>", "<SERVICE ID>")\n\n        # Get to work...\n\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\n1. [Check for open features/bugs](https://github.com/bachya/aiorecollect/issues)\n  or [initiate a discussion on one](https://github.com/bachya/aiorecollect/issues/new).\n2. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/bachya/aiorecollect/fork).\n3. (_optional, but highly recommended_) Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`\n4. (_optional, but highly recommended_) Enter the virtual environment: `source ./.venv/bin/activate`\n5. Install the dev environment: `script/setup`\n6. Code your new feature or bug fix.\n7. Write tests that cover your new functionality.\n8. Run tests and ensure 100% code coverage: `script/test`\n9. Update `README.md` with any new documentation.\n10. Add yourself to `AUTHORS.md`.\n11.
