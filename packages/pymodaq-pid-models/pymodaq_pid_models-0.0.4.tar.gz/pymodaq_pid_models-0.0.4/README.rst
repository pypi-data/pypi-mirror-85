# PyMoDAQ PID models

PyMoDAQ, Modular Data Acquisition with Python, is a set of **python** modules used to perform automated measurements. 

This repository contains various models to interpret measurements from Viewer modules to feed a PID loop and translate
as well outputs to send to actuators in order to stabilize the closed loop system
