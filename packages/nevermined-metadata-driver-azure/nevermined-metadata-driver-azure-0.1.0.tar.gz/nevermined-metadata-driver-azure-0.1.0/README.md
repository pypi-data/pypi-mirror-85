## Quickstart

To login in Azure cloud you need to execute the driver with the next environment variables set:
```bash
AZURE_CLIENT_ID
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
AZURE_TENANT_ID
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

To get information about how to create an App principal for Metadata Azure driver in your Azure account, please
refer to Azure documentation. Links:
  - [#1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/azure/python-sdk-azure-authenticate?view=azure-python)
  - [#2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?toc=%2Fazure%2Fazure-resource-manager%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-cli-latest)
  - [#3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal)


At the moment there is only a first implementation for the data_plugin, but in the future is going to be an instance 
for the computing plugin as well.
