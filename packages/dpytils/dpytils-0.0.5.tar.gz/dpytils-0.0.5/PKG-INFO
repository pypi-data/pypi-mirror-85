Description: # dpytils
        
        ## What is this?
        
        It is a package with basic utilities for a discord bot main in discord.py.
        
        ## How do I use it?
        
        To use it, simply import it, and initialize the `dpytils.utils()` class.
        
        ```python
        from dpytils import utils
        utilities = utils()
        ```
        
        ## What utilities are there?
        
        Currently, only three. `randcolor()`, `permsfromvalue()`, and `GuildConverter`.
        
        ### randcolor
        
        This function will return a random color (of type int) to be used for a discord embed, or anything else.
        
        ### permsfromvalue
        
        This function will return another class, discordPermissions, which contains the following values.
        
        #### permsfromvalue.perms_raw
        
        The raw discord permissions object from [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).
        
        #### permsfromvalue.perms_true
        
        A list of permission names that are `True` from the given value
        
        #### permsfromvalue.perms_false
        
        A list of permission names that are `False` from the given value
        
        #### permsfromvalue.perms_nice
        
        A nicely formatted string with a list of permissions, and emoji to show true/false.
        
        ### GuildConverter
        
        This will attempt to convert whatever you give it to a guild object. You must pass both a context object, and a value to search for to it. Example:
        
        ```python
        search_term = "test ser"
        guild = await utils().GuildConverter(ctx, search_term)
        return guild # <discord.Guild id=647392781730285629 name='bot testing server'>
        ```
