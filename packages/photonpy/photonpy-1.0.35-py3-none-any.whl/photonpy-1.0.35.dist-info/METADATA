A C++/CUDA toolbox with python bindings for doing single molecule microscopy image processing.

Features include:    
    - Super fast spot detection and extraction on tiff files (~1k frames/s on my dell xps laptop)
    - Max-Likelihood fitting of various 2D Gaussian models
        (XY with or without fixed sigma, 3D using astigmatism)
    - SIMFLUX (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0657-7)
    - Easy rendering of results: Piccaso Render compatible HDF5 export (https://github.com/jungmannlab/picasso)
    - Phasor-based SMLM (https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.5005899)
    - A C++ templated approach to quickly implement new PSF models as long as the first derivative can be computed.
    - Drift correction in 2D and 3D
    - Localization using cubic spline PSFs from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6009849/

Currently compiled for CUDA 10.1 update 2 / Windows x64 using Visual Studio 2019
