        Protocol found at https://bkpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/manuals/en-us/85xx_manual.pdf
        in the "Command details" section.
        
        
        Command Line Interface
        ======================
        
        I added some command line interface utilities that use python's "-m" module switch.
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install pybk8500[all]
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
          * pyserial>=3.4
          * continuous-threading>=2.0.0
        
        
        Send Command
        ------------
        
        Send a command to a serial port and wait for a response.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            python -m pybk8500.send_cmd "COM1" 9600 "RemoteOn" --address 1
            # will send the command down a serial port and wait for a response
        
        The command ID can be the string NAME or integer ID.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            # cmd_id as str
            python -m pybk8500.send_cmd "COM1" 9600 "SetRemote" --value 1 --address 1
        
            # cmd_id as hex
            python -m pybk8500.send_cmd "COM1" 9600 0x20 --value 1 --address 1
        
            # cmd_id as decimal
            python -m pybk8500.send_cmd "COM1" 9600 32 --value 1 --address 1
        
        
        Parser
        ======
        
        The parser is used to parse incoming messages. It can be used with to parse single messages,
        parse messages with an iterator, or parse using a callback function.
        
        
        Parse Iterator Example
        ----------------------
        
        Use a for loop to iterate through parsed messages.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import pybk8500
        
            with open('saved_messages.txt', 'rb') as f:
                p = pybk8500.Parser()
        
                for msg in p.parse_iter(f.read()):
                    print(msg.NAME)
                    for field, value in msg.fields().items():
                        print('\t{} = {}'.format(field, value))
        
        
        Parse Callback Example
        ----------------------
        
        Use a callback function to handle parsed messages. This is useful for GUI's with a serial port.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import sys
            import pybk8500
        
            def print_error(error):
                print('{}: {}'.format(type(error).__name__, str(error)), file=sys.stderr)
        
            def print_msg(msg):
                print(msg.NAME)
                for field, value in msg.fields().items():
                    print('\t{} = {}'.format(field, value))
        
            p = pybk8500.Parser()
            p.error = print_error
        
            with open('saved_messages.txt', 'rb') as f:
                p.parse(f.read(), print_msg)
        
        
        Parse Single Message Example
        ----------------------------
        
        Parse a single message at a time.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        
            import sys
            import pybk8500
        
            def print_error(error):
                print('{}: {}'.format(type(error).__name__, str(error)), file=sys.stderr)
        
        
            with open('saved_messages.txt', 'rb') as f:
                p = pybk8500.Parser()
        
                byts = f.read()
                while True:
                    msg, error, byts = self.parse_msg(byts)
                    if msg is not None:
                        print(msg.NAME)
                        for field, value in msg.fields().items():
                            print('\t{} = {}'.format(field, value))
                    elif error is not None:
                        print_error(error)
                    else:
                        break
        
        
        Commands
        ========
        
        Generate commands and send them down a serial port
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
          * pyserial
        
        `pip install pyserial`
        
        
        Use Commands
        ------------
        
        Create and use command easily.
        
        Commands can be found at https://bkpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/manuals/en-us/85xx_manual.pdf
        in the "Command details" section.
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import pybk8500
            import serial
        
            ser = serial.Serial('COM1', 9600)
        
            cmd = pybk8500.SetRemoteOperation(address=1, operation='Remote')
            ser.write(bytes(cmd))
        
            # Most commands have a value alias
            cmd = pybk8500.SetRemoteOperation(address=1, value='Remote')
            ser.write(bytes(cmd))
        
        
        Commands are bytearrays which can be used as bytes. When you change a value a flag is set to indicate that the
        checksum must be recalculated. Calling `bytes(cmd)` will recalculate the checksum before converting to bytes.
        
        
        Profile
        =======
        
        Custom profile CSV runner.
        
        
        CSV
        ---
        
        The CSV of profile commands is defined by "Command", "Value", "Run Time (s)".
        
          * Command - Name of the command you want to send.
        
           * Runs any command registered in "pybk8500.Parser.lookup" as well as predefined custom internal commands.
        
           * Commands can be a name "SetRemote", hex value "0x20", or decimal value 32.
        
          * Value - Value to pass into the command.
        
           * The Command needs the "value" alias or custom internal command.
        
           * Accepts units! "1 mW" will be parsed and converted to "0.001 W"
        
          * Run Time (s) - Turn on the load and run for the given amount of time.
        
           * Accepts Units "1 h" or "1:00:00" will be parsed and converted to "3600 s"
        
        
        Commands
        --------
        
         * Comment line by starting the line with "#" or ";"
         * Internal Commands
        
          * "SetupRemote,," - Turn On Remote, Turn Off Load
          * "TeardownRemote,," - Turn Off Load, Turn Off Remote
          * "Run,,10 s" - Run the current mode by turning on the load and reading the input for the run time.
          * "Connect,," - Connect the serial port.
          * "SampleRate,40," - Set the read input time sample rate (1/value delay after each read).
          * "SampleTime,0.1," - Set the read input time (value delay after each read).
          * "BaudRate,38400," - Set the serial port baud rate.
          * "Com,COM1," - Set the serial com port.
          * "Port,COM1," - Set the serial com port.
          * "Output,my_file.csv," - Set the output file for any subsequent runs.
        
           * "Output,," - Print the results for subsequent runs.
        
          * "Print,===== Print =====," - Print the value ("===== Print =====") to stdout.
          * "Sleep,0.1 s," - Sleep the given amount of time
        
           * "Sleep,,0.1 s" - Sleep with timeout also works
        
          * "Stop,," - Stop running the program here. This is a hard stop that can be useful for debugging.
        
         * All defined commands in "pybk8500.commands.py" can be used
        
          * "CC,3 A,100 ms" - Set Constant Current of value (3 A).
        
           * If "Run Time (s)" is given run this mode for the given amount of time.
        
          * "CV,12 V,1" - Set Constant Voltage of value (12 V).
        
           * If "Run Time (s)" is given run this mode for the given amount of time.
        
          * "CW,1,08:00" - Set Constant Power of value (1 W).
        
           * If "Run Time (s)" is given run this mode for the given amount of time.
        
          * "CR,1,1" - Set Constant Resistance of value (1 Ohm).
        
           * If "Run Time (s)" is given run this mode for the given amount of time.
