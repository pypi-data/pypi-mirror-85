This mouse click opens the form for providing new add-ons. The form dialog consists
of several register. The form fields in the first register asks for more general
information about the project. It's possible to edit and change the content of the
fields later, if the focus or the features of the project varies.

The First Register 'Default'
****************************

The new add-on project needs its own title with a length from 5 to 50 characters. This title
has to be unique inside the 'Add-on Center'. If there is already another add-on project
with the same title the member will get an error message with the appropriate information.
Thus he had to choose another title for his add-on project.

A new project needs also a summary and could get a full description of its purpose and features.
The latter one is optional (only form fields with a red point behind the title are mandatory).

It's also necessary that the member provides an email-address. This address will be used to
get in contact with the project (owner). The 'Add-on Center' sends e.g. messages if the status
of the project changes (e.g. it was published by a reviewer). Users of the project / add-on could
send feedback to the author within a form. The content of this form will be send by email to
the project (owner) (The feedback provider will not see the email address of the project).

If there is already a homepage of the add-on project available on the internet, it is possible to
submit within the correspondending form field. This homepage will be published inside the project
ressources on the right side of the add-on project page. Thus the user of the project / add-on
could reach the external project homepage very easily with only one mouse click.

The Second Register 'Category / Categories'
*******************************************

The add-on projects were assigned to one or more categories. The creator of the add-on project
could choose on this register one or more categories, the new add-on project matches. The list
of categories on this register had been created by the Plone site administrator within the
'Add-on Center'.
