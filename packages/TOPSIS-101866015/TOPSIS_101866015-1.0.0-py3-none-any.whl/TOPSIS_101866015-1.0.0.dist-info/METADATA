### Title:Multiple Criteria Decision Making using TOPSIS

## What is TOPSIS:
TOPSIS is an acronym that stands for 'Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution' and is a pretty straightforward MCDA method.
It is a multi-criteria decision analysis method, which was originally developed by Ching-Lai Hwang and Yoon in 1981 with further developments by Yoon in 1987, and Hwang, Lai and Liu in 1993.
#### How to install the TOPSIS package
```buildoutcfg
pip install TOPSIS_101866105
```
#### For Calculating the TOPSIS Score
```buildoutcfg
Topsis data.csv "0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25" "-,+,+,+" result.csv
```

##### Input File(Example:data.csv):
Argument used to pass the path of the input file which conatins a dataset having different fields and to perform the topsis mathematical operations
##### Weights(Example:"0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25")
The weights to assigned to the different parameters in the dataset should be passed in the argument.**It must be seperated by ','.**
##### Impacts(Example:"-,+,+,+"):
The impacts are passed to consider which parameters have a positive impact on the decision and which one have the negative impact.**Only '+' and '-' values should be passed and should be seperated with ',' only**
##### Output File(Example:result.csv):
This argument is used to pass the path of the result file where we want the rank and score to be stored
