At present it supports APIs to detect and model\ncompatibility relationships among different CPU microarchitectures.\n\n## Getting started with development\n\nThe `archspec` Python package needs [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to\nbe installed from VCS sources. The preferred method to install it is via\nits custom installer outside of any virtual environment:\n```console\n$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python\n```\nYou can refer to [Poetry's documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)\nfor further details or for other methods to install this tool. You'll also need `tox`\nto run unit test:\n```console\n$ pip install --user tox\n```\nFinally you'll need to clone the repository:\n```console\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/archspec/archspec.git\n```\n\n### Running unit tests\nOnce you have your environment ready you can run `archspec` unit tests\nusing ``tox`` from the root of the repository:\n```console\n$ tox\n  [ ... ]\n  py27: commands succeeded\n  py35: commands succeeded\n  py36: commands succeeded\n  py37: commands succeeded\n  py38: commands succeeded\n  pylint: commands succeeded\n  flake8: commands succeeded\n  black: commands succeeded\n  congratulations :)\n```\n\n## License\n\nArchspec is distributed under the terms of both the MIT license and the\nApache License (Version 2.0).
