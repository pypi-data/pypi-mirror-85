Description: # Implementation of TOPSIS by Lakshya Gupta
        This package calculates topsis/performance score for given .csv file, thus helping in Multiple Critera Decision Making (MCDM).
        
        ## Important Details
        
        ##### Input File
        
        - The input file must be a .csv or .txt file only.
        - The input file must have atleast three columns.
        - The first column of the input file is the object/variable name. (e.g. X1, X2, X3, X4...)
        - All columns except the first (name) column contain numeric values only.
        
        ##### Output File
        - The output file contains two new columns i.e. Topsis Score and Rank along with the original columns.
        
        ##### Parameters for the **topsis** function are as follows
        - The **input file name**. It must end with .csv or .txt. The complete file path must be given to read the file residing in a different directory.
        
        - The **weights** string that contains the weights for each column separated by commas.
           Example: "0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25"
        
        - The **impacts** string that contains the impacts for each column separated by commas.
           Example: "+,+,-,+"
        
        - The **output file name**. It must end with .csv or .txt. The complete file path must be given to save the file in a different directory.
        
        ##### The **topsis** function must be called with all 4 parameters otherwise exceptions will be raised.
