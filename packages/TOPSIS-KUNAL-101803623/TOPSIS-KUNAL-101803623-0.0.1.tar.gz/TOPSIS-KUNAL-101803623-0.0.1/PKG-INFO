Description: # TOPSIS-KUNAL-101803623
        
        TOPSIS-KUNAL-101803623 is a package that will provide feature to do multi-criteria decision making in choosing the best models among the data provided.
        
          - It will provide with the TOPSIS Score.
          - It will do Ranking of Models on the basis of the given data.
        
        # TOPSIS:
        
        Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) originated in the 1980s as a multi-criteria decision making method. TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution, and greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution. 
        
        
        ### Installation
        TOPSIS-KUNAL-101803623 requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) v2.7+ to run.
        
        Install the package using pip as follows :
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install TOPSI-KUNAL-101803623
        ```
        
        ### HOW TO USE THIS PACKAGE
        
        TOPSIS-KUNAL-10803623 can be run as in the following examples:
        
        
        **IN PYTHON IDLE :**
        
        NOTE: 
        1. Pre-processing is to be done only in-case of non-numeric data in input file.
        2. Ensure that the number of weights and impacts is equal to the no of columns excluding the first one in the preprocesed data.
        
        ```sh
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> from topsis import TopsisScore
        >>> dataset = pd.read_csv('data.csv') #data.csv the file containing the input data
        >>> dataset = prepocess(dataset) # Preprocessing as mentioned above of data
        >>> w = [1,1,1,2] 
        >>> im = ['+','+','-','+'] 
        >>> """checking the no of weights and imapcts should be equal to no of columns in dataset  
        >>>    excluding the first column in the preprocessed dataset """
        >>> noofparameterreq = len(dataset.columns)-1
        >>> if (len(weights) != noofparameterreq) or (len(impacts) != noofparameterreq) :
        >>>     print("The no of parameters required for weights and impacts is : " +                   
                str(noofparameterreq))
                raise Exception('Inavalid no of parameters in weights or impacts')
        >>> dataset = TopsisScore(dataset,w,im)
        >>> print(dataset) #returns pandas dataframe with rank and topsis score included 
        ```
        
        ### Sample Dataset
        The decision matrix (a) will be extracted from the csv file as the pandas dataframe which will contain each row representing a Model alternative, and each column representing a criterion like Accuracy, RSeq, Root Mean Squared Error, Correlation, and many more.
        
        | Model | Correlation | RSeq | RMSE | Accuracy
        | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | --------
        | M1 | 0.79 | 0.62 | 1.25 | 60.89 
        | M2 | 0.66 | 0.44 | 2.89 | 63.07
        | M3 | 0.56 | 0.31 | 1.57 | 62.87
        | M4 | 0.82 | 0.67 | 2.68 | 70.19
        | M5 | 0.75 | 0.56 | 1.3 | 80.39
        
        Weights (w) is not already normalised will be normalised later in the code.
        Information of impacts positive(+) or negative(-) impact criteria should be provided in (im).
        
        **No of weights and no of impacts should be equal to no. of columns in dataset excluding the first column** 
        
        ### Sample Output
        
        The rankings are displayed in the form of a table, with the 1st rank offering us the best decision, and last rank offering the worst decision making, according to TOPSIS method.
        
        | Model | Correlation | RSeq | RMSE | Accuracy | Topsis Score | Rank
        | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | -------- | -------- | --------
        | M1 | 0.79 | 0.62 | 1.25 | 60.89 | 0.639133 | 2
        | M2 | 0.66 | 0.44 | 2.89 | 63.07 | 0.212592 | 5
        | M3 | 0.56 | 0.31 | 1.57 | 62.87 | 0.407846 | 4
        | M4 | 0.82 | 0.67 | 2.68 | 70.19 | 0.519153 | 3
        | M5 | 0.75 | 0.56 | 1.3 | 80.39 | 0.828267 | 1
