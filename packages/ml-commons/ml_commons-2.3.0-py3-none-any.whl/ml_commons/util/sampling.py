    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : array-like
        The target variable for supervised learning problems.
        Stratification is done based on the labels.

    select : float or int
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the indices to be used. If int, represents
        the absolute number of indices.

    Returns

    selected : list
        Selected indices.
