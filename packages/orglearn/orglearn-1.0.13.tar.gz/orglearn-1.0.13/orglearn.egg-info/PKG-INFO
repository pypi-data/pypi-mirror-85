        # Orglearn
        
        Orglean provides toolbox for learning from your org-mode notes. It can generate mind
        maps, anki decks and even pdfs textbooks.
        
        ## Modes [commands]
        
        ### Anki
        
        Convert notes to anki deck. The convertor will take all leafs of the tree (nodes
        without children) and convert them into anki cards. The node title is
        front-side of the card and the body is the back-side of the card.
        
        ### Mind map
        
        Convert notes into a [mid map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map). This is a
        good way to visualize the relationships between each node.
        
        ### PDF
        
        Orglearn is able to create pdf from your notes. You can achieve similar results
        converting org files to pdf using emacs. But we think that using `pandoc`
        results in better looking pdfs and gives us the best way to customize the result.
        
        To be able to convert org files to pdf you need to have `pandoc` installed on
        your system.
