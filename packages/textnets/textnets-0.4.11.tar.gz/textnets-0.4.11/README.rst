**textnets** represents collections of texts as networks of documents and
words. This provides novel possibilities for the visualization and analysis of
texts.

The idea underlying **textnets** is presented in this paper:

  Christopher A. Bail, "`Combining natural language processing and network
  analysis to examine how advocacy organizations stimulate conversation on social
  media`__," *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States
  of America* 113, no. 42 (2016), 11823–11828, doi:10.1073/pnas.1607151113.

Features
--------

**textnets** builds on the state-of-the-art library `spacy`_ for
natural-language processing and `igraph`_ for network analysis. It uses the
`Leiden algorithm`_ for community detection, which is able to perform community
detection on the bipartite (word–group) network.

.. _`Leiden algorithm`: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08473
.. _`igraph`: http://igraph.org/python/
.. _`spacy`: https://spacy.io/

**textnets** seamlessly integrates with `pandas`_ and other parts of Python's
excellent `scientific stack`_. That means that you can use **textnets** in
Jupyter notebooks to analyze and visualize your data!

**textnets** is easily installable using the ``conda`` and ``pip`` package
managers.
