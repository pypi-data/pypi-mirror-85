I didn\'t want to have to fiddle with the command-line, and also wanted a cross-platform solution. Thus was born `chime`!\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\npip install chime\n```\n\nThis library has **no dependencies**. The IPython/Jupyter functionality is only imported if you\'ve installed the `ipython` library. It should work for any Python version above or equal to 3.6.\n\n## Basic usage\n\n`chime` puts four functions at your disposal:\n\n```py\n>>> import chime\n\n>>> chime.success()\n>>> chime.warning()\n>>> chime.error()\n>>> chime.info()\n\n```\n\nCalling any of the above functions will play a sound. Note that the sounds are played in asynchronous processes, and are thus non-blocking. Each function should take around 2ms to execute, regardless of the sound length. You\'re free to use each sound notification in any way you see fit. I\'m not your mama.\n\n## Theming\n\nThe sounds that are played depend on which theme is being used.\n\n```py\n>>> chime.theme()  # return the current theme\n\'chime\'\n\n```\n\nSeveral themes are available:\n\n```py\n>>> chime.themes()\n[\'chime\', \'mario\', \'zelda\']\n\n```\n\nThe theme can be changed by passing a theme name to the `theme` function:\n\n```py\n>>> chime.theme(\'zelda\')\n\n```\n\nA couple of things to note:\n\n- You can listen to the sounds interactively via [this soundboard](https://chime-soundboard.herokuapp.com/), which is made with [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/).\n- A random theme will be picked each time you play a sound if you set the theme to `\'random\'`.\n\n## IPython/Jupyter magic\n\nLoad the extension as so:\n\n```py\n%load_ext chime\n```\n\nYou can wrap a line:\n\n```py\n%chime print("I\'m a line")\n```\n\nYou can also wrap an entire cell:\n\n```py\n%%chime\n\nprint("I\'m a cell")\n```\n\nThe magic command will call `chime.success` when the line/cell finishes successfully. Otherwise, `chime.error` is called whenever an exception is raised.\n\n## Exception notifications\n\nIf you run `chime.notify_exceptions`, then `chime.error` will be called whenever an exception is raised.\n\n```py\nchime.notify_exceptions()\n\nraise ValueError("I\'m going to make some noise")\n```\n\n## Command-line usage\n\nYou can run `chime` from the command-line:\n\n```sh\n$ chime\n```\n\nBy default, this will play the success sound. You can also choose which sound to play, like so:\n\n```sh\n$ chime info\n```\n\nYou can also choose which theme to use:\n\n```sh\n$ chime info --theme zelda\n```\n\nIf you\'re using bash, then you can use `chime` to notify you when a program finishes:\n\n```sh\n$ echo "Hello world!"; chime\n```\n\nThis will play the sound regardless of the fact that the first command succeeded or not. If you\'re running on Windows, then you can run the following equivalent:\n\n```sh\n> echo "Hello world!" & chime\n```\n\n## Platform support\n\nUnder the hood, `chime` runs a command in the shell to play a `.wav` file. The command-line program that is used depends on the [platform](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computing_platform) that you\'re using. Platform information is available in the [`sys.platform` variable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform) as well as the [`platform` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html) from the standard library. Currently, the supported platforms are:\n\n- Darwin\n- Linux\n- Windows\n\nA `UserWarning` is raised if you run a `chime` sound on an unsupported platform. Feel free to get in touch or issue a pull request if you want to add support for a specific platform. Likewise, don\'t hesitate if you\'re encountering trouble with one of the above platforms. I won\'t bite.\n\n## I can\'t hear anything 🙉\n\nDid you check if you turned your sound on? Just kidding. 😜\n\nThis library is designed to be non-invasive. By default, sounds are played asynchronously in unchecked processes. Therefore, if something goes wrong, the process dies silently. If you can\'t hear anything and you think that the issue is coming from `chime`, then set the `sync` parameter when you play a sound:\n\n```py\n>>> chime.info(sync=True)\n\n```\n\nThis will play the sound synchronously and issue a warning if something goes wrong, which should allow you to debug the issue. You can also raise an exception instead of sending a warning by setting the `raise_error` parameter:\n\n```py\n>>> chime.info(sync=True, raise_error=True)\n\n```\n\nNote that setting `raise_error` won\'t do anything if `sync` is set to `False`.\n\n## Adding a new theme\n\nI have toyed with the idea of allowing users to add their own theme(s), but at the moment I rather keep things minimal. However, I\'m happy to integrate new themes into the library. You can propose a new theme by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/creme-ml/creme/issues/new) that adds the necessary .wav files to the [`themes` directory](https://github.com/MaxHalford/chime/tree/main/themes). A theme is made up of four files: `success.wav`, `warning.wav`, `error.wav`, and `info.wav`. Be creative! 👩\u200d🎨\n\n## Things to do\n\n- Some mechanism to automatically call `chime.warning` when a warning occurs.\n- More themes!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- Special thanks to [Michael Vlah](https://github.com/vlahm) for being a gentleman by giving up the "chime" name on PyPI.\n- Thanks to u/Pajke on reddit for helping me debug Windows support.\n- Thanks to [David Chen](https://github.com/dchen327) for adding Linux support by suggesting the use of [aplay](https://linux.die.net/man/1/aplay).\n- Thanks to [Vincent Warmerdam](https://twitter.com/fishnets88) for suggesting a command-line interface.\n- Calmcode made a [video introduction to chime](https://calmcode.io/chime/introduction.html) ❤️\n- Thanks to [Paulo S.
