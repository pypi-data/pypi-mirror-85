        long_description = '\nThe mpcurses provides a framework that enables a function to be executed at scale and its execution to be visualized on screen at runtime. It consists of a simple set of APIs that provide an abstraction for multiprocessing and the curses screen painting library. The main features:\n\n* Execute a function across one or more concurrent processes\n* Queue execution to ensure a predefined number of processes are running\n* Visualize function execution using curses screen\n* Define a screen layout using a Python dict\n* Leverage built-in directives for dynamically updating the screen\n  * Keep numeric counts\n  * Update text values\n  * Update text colors\n  * Maintain visual indicators\n  * Update progress bars\n  * Display tables\n\nThe framework can be used on any ordinary Python function. The only requirement for enabling function scale and execution visualization is to ensure the function implements logging and a to provide a screen layout definition. The framework takes care of setting up the multiprocessing, configuring the curses screen and the maintaining the thread-safe queues required for communication.\n\n\nRefer to [How It Works](https://github.com/soda480/mpcurses/wiki/How-It-Works) for additional detail.\n\n\nRefer to [API Reference](https://github.com/soda480/mpcurses/wiki/API-Reference) for description of the API methods and the screen layout directives.\n\n\nFor samples checkout our home page: https://github.com/soda480/mpcurses\n',
