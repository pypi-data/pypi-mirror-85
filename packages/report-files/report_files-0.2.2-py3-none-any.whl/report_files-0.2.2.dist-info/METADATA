## WARNING

This project has the same functionality of my project [reportFile](https://github.com/alepuzio/reportFile).
So, any other updated of this project is postponed until either the project will be joined.


# ListFiles
--------
This application build tow report file, by passing an absolute or relative path:
- report CSV with all the files inside the directory. The data are: 
 -- path
 -- name of the file
 -- dimension in byte
 -- extension
 -- date of creation or last update

- report with all the files and, for every of these, a table with the data of the (probable) duplicates. The data are: 
-- complete path
-- dimsione in byte
-- date fo creation of last update

## BugFix

### Future
 - problem with _IndexError_, not better identified
 - the name of the printed file has to join to the extension

### Next
 - The input arguments have to be validated before the elaboration

### Running
 - None

### Past
 - fix the run

## Features

### Future
- Write a report with some filter in input (e.g. only files with a particural extension, only files after a date etc)
- Write a report with all the documents or images or video 
- Change the name and url of the Github repository
- Show the directories with no elements 

### Next
- Fix the style of the files and the classes as [PEP8] (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

### Running
- Write the file of _Contributing_ as [this] ( https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426/forks)

### Past
- The project is structured for CI in Travis
- The directory of the source has the same name of the application, not _src_
- The directory of the source has the classes with no unit test
- The classes with unit test are moved inside the module of test (an idea of mine to coupling stronger test and source code)


## Status CI Integration

 I use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alepuzio/listfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alepuzio/list-files)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.0+
- pip
- pytest 

### Installing

- Clone the project with _git-clone_ (or download directly it)
- Have fun!


## Running the tests

 - I use __pytest__ framework. In the modul inside __tests__ directory, I put also the classes from typical __src__ directory (I prefer to have class and test in the same class).
 - Every unit test is declared inside the class, because for me test and implementation musto go together (highly coupled)

### Break down into to end to end tests

No indications


### Coding styles sheets

Please read the file [CONTRIBUTING.md](http://github.com/alepuzio/listfiles/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Deployment

 - Package in PyPi
 - Run    __>>> python Main.py $PATH_OF_ROOT_DIRECTORY_

### Built with:

- [ViM](http://www.vim.org) - one of the best text editor I know
- [pytest](https://pytest.org) - mature and full-featured Python testing tool, more advanced than [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
