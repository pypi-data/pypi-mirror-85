Description
===========

Management Dashboard micro-service provides a set of CRUD, import,
export, and compartment related CLI (such as change compartment)   to
support dashboard and saved search metadata preservation.  These CLI
are mainly for client UIs, for various UI activities such as get list
of all saved searches in a compartment, create a dashboard, open a
saved search, etc.  Use export to retrieve  dashboards and their saved
searches, then edit the Json if necessary (for example change
compartmentIds), then import the result to  destination dashboard
service. CLI validate all required properties to ensure properties are
present and have correct type and values.
