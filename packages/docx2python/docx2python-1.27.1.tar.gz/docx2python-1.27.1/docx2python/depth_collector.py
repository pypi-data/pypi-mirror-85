Text in table cells and text outside of a table must be captured at depth=5. To keep
track of this, these few methods will put text where it needs to be.

The package will recursively descend into elements in the docx file, so the point at
which a table, row, cell, paragraph, or text run begins and ends is known. Drop and
raise the caret when these items are opened or closed in the xml. Insert text when
found.

Shorthand for this package. Instances of this class should not escape the package.
Pass out of package with depth_collector_instance.tree.
