        ### Title:Multiple Criteria Decision Making using TOPSIS
        
        ## What is TOPSIS:
        TOPSIS is an acronym that stands for 'Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution' and is a pretty straightforward MCDA method.
        It is a multi-criteria decision analysis method, which was originally developed by Ching-Lai Hwang and Yoon in 1981 with further developments by Yoon in 1987, and Hwang, Lai and Liu in 1993.
        #### How to install the TOPSIS package
        ```buildoutcfg
        pip install TOPSIS-ParthArora-101853039
        ```
        #### For Calculating the TOPSIS Score
        ```buildoutcfg
        Topsis data.csv "0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25" "-,+,+,+" result.csv
        ```
        
        ##### Input File(Example:data.csv):
        Argument used to pass the path of the input file which conatins a dataset having different fields and to perform the topsis mathematical operations
        ##### Weights(Example:"0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25")
        The weights to assigned to the different parameters in the dataset should be passed in the argument.**It must be seperated by ','.**
        ##### Impacts(Example:"-,+,+,+"):
        The impacts are passed to consider which parameters have a positive impact on the decision and which one have the negative impact.**Only '+' and '-' values should be passed and should be seperated with ',' only**
        ##### Output File(Example:result.csv):
        This argument is used to pass the path of the result file where we want the rank and score to be stored
