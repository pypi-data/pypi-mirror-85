          'return_to_proposing_group' wfAdaptation is selectable

          portal_setup step do not change workflow selected on these types as it is different when

        ------------------

          when the item is decided
        - Added possibility to manage MeetingItem.itemIsSigned when item is
          'presented' or 'itemfrozen' besides the fact that it is still manageable
          when the item is decided
        - Added a 'Echevinat' faceted advanced criterion based on groupsOfMatter index
        - Moved historization of signed financial advice to real versions
        - Added listType 'Addendum' for items of Council (added possibility to define 'items
          without a number' as well)
        - Added possibility to manually send items from College to Council once item is 'itemfrozen'
        - Restricted power observers may not see 'late' council items if not decided
        - Added state 'sent_to_council_emergency' on a College item to make it possible
          to keep a link between a College item and a Council item emergency if the original
          College item was not linked to a meeting
        - When a Council item is 'delayed', it is automatically sent back to College in 'itemcreated'
          state to make full validation process again in College to be sent again in Council, finance
          advice does not follow
        - When a Council item is 'returned', it is automatically sent back to College in 'validated'
          state to be immediatelly presentable in a next meeting, finance advice does follow
        - When a Council item is presented, automatically add the COUNCILITEM_DECISIONEND_SENTENCE at
          the end of the item's decisionEnd if not already
        - Make sure a MeetingGroup may not be removed if used in MeetingConfig.archivingRefs or
          MeetingCategory.groupsOfMatter
        - Do only let ask advices (by item creator or internal reviewer) if some advices will be giveable in
          the state the item will be (itemcreated_waiting_advices or
          proposed_to_internal_reviewer_waiting_advices)
        - When a College item was sent to Council (when it was frozen) and the final decision on the College item
          is "delayed", delete the item that was sent to the Council
        - Do every manuallyLinkedItems of an item having finance advice accessible to the finance advisers
        - Hide some elements for restricted power observers : some fileters, columns and access to element's history
        - Added 'positive_with_remarks_finance' to the list of advice_type selectable by finance advisers,
          this behaves exactly like 'positive_finance' in every cases, except the icon that shows to the user
          that a comment has been added to the advice
        - Power observers (not restricted) may access every decision annexes
        - When an item is 'returned', keep original creator for duplicated items
        - Do not rely on Products.MeetingCommunes for the testing part as we do not
          override every PM tests in MC, we just heritate from PM test file
        - Get rid of ToolPloneMeeting.formatMeetingDate override that displayed a '*' for meetings where
          adoptsNextCouncilAgenda=True, we use imio.prettylink _leadingIcons now
        - Moved finances specific advices to their own portal_type 'meetingadvicefinances'
        - Removed field 'MeetingItem.privacyForCouncil', instead we will use new builtin PM functionnality 
          'MeetingItem.otherMeetingConfigsClonableToPrivacy' that does the same
