- Added state 'sent_to_council_emergency' on a College item to make it possible
  to keep a link between a College item and a Council item emergency if the original
  College item was not linked to a meeting
- When a Council item is 'delayed', it is automatically sent back to College in 'itemcreated'
  state to make full validation process again in College to be sent again in Council, finance
  advice does not follow

  MeetingCategory.groupsOfMatter

- When an item is 'returned', keep original creator for duplicated items
- Do not rely on Products.MeetingCommunes for the testing part as we do not
  override every PM tests in MC, we just heritate from PM test file
- Get rid of ToolPloneMeeting.formatMeetingDate override that displayed a '*' for meetings where
  adoptsNextCouncilAgenda=True, we use imio.prettylink _leadingIcons now
- Moved finances specific advices to their own portal_type 'meetingadvicefinances'
- Removed field 'MeetingItem.privacyForCouncil', instead we will use new builtin PM functionnality 
  'MeetingItem.otherMeetingConfigsClonableToPrivacy' that does the same
