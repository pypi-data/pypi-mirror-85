"""
This module defines the core of the framework, including the
abstraction of ``Neurons``, ``Synapses``, ``Monitor``, ``Network``,
and numerical integrator methods.

The core is so small, and the overall framework is easy to
understand. Using it, you can easily write your own neurons,
synapses, etc.
