Description-Content-Type: text/markdown


dtmm is an electro-magnetic field transmission and reflection calculation engine and visualizer. It can be used for calculation of transmission or reflection properties of layered homogeneous or inhomogeneous materials, such as confined liquid-crystals with homogeneous or inhomogeneous director profile. DTMM stands for Diffractive Transfer Matrix Method and is an adapted Berreman 4x4 transfer matrix method and an adapted 2x2 extended Jones method.
