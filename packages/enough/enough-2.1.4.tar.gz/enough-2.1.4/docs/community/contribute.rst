Contribute
==========

This is the contribution guide to the `enough.community`
infrastructure which is based on Ansible and OpenStack. If you're a
seasoned Free Software contributor looking for a quick start, take a
look at the `list of bugs and features
<https://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/issues>`__,
otherwise keep reading.

.. note:: If you want to contribute to the Enough code base, take
          a look at `the repository <https://lab.Enough.community/main/app>`__.

Bugs and features list
----------------------

Each service under the `enough.community` domain can be worked on
independently and have their own integration tests. There is no need
to understand how `Weblate` is deployed if you're improving
`Discourse`, for instance.

All contributors are `organized horizontally <https://enough.community/blog/2020/01/20/manifesto/>`__

.. _getting_started:

Getting started
---------------

* ``git clone https://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure``

Running tests
-------------

* Install Docker.

The ``tests/run-tests.sh`` script builds a docker image suitable for
running the tests, with all the required dependencies, based on a
Debian GNU/Linux buster. The following volumes are bind-mounted:

* ~/.enough
* ~/.ansible
* the root of the `infrastructure` repository

The working directory, in the container, is the root of the
`infrastructure` repository.

Running tests that do not require OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no need to have OpenStack credentials to run these tests.

* ``PYTEST_ADDOPTS='-m "not openstack_integration"' tests/run-tests.sh``


Running tests that require OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
++++++++++++

The tests running without OpenStack only cover a fraction of what
Enough does. To verify that a playbook actually works, it needs to be
run on a live host and tests must check that is working.  For instance
the tests for weblate request that the weblate server sends a mail and
verify it is relayed by the postfix server.

When modifying a role or a playbook in the directory `playbooks/ABC`
one is expected to add a test for the new behavior and verify it runs
successfully:

* ``tests/run-tests.sh tox -e ABC``

When relevant, integration tests should be created as `icinga`
monitoring checks so they can be run on a regular basis in the
production environment to verify it keeps working.

Obtain an API token
+++++++++++++++++++

Most integration tests need a publicly available DNS server. The
https://api.enough.community provides a publicly available API to
delegate a domain to the designated DNS server. Members of the `group
enough <https://lab.enough.community/groups/enough/-/group_members>`_
can sign-in, others can `request access
<https://lab.enough.community/groups/enough>`_.

.. image:: api0.png

.. image:: api1.png

The **Token:** value displayed after signing in https://api.enough.community
must be set to the ``ENOUGH_API_TOKEN`` environment variable.

* ``ENOUGH_API_TOKEN=XXXXXXX tests/run-tests.sh tox -e bind``

Set the OpenStack credentials using openrc.sh
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Assuming you have your own OVH tenant or one was :ref:`provided to you
<infrastructure>`, the credentials must be set in environment
variables as follows:

* ``source openrc.sh``

Set the OpenStack credentials using clouds.yml
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An alternative to ``openrc.sh`` is to use ``clouds.yml`` file:

* ``cp clouds.provider.yml inventory/group_vars/all/clouds.yml``

Note that ``openrc.sh`` file is ignored if ``inventory/group_vars/all/clouds.yml`` exists.

Running
+++++++

* ``tests/run-tests.sh tox -e <service name>``

..  note::
    If the command fails, because of a network failure or any other reason,
    it is safe to run it again. It is idempotent and will re-use the environment
    from the failed test.

The list of service names (i.e. tox test environments) is in the `tox.ini` file. It is possible
to skip some steps to speed up test debugging:

.. code::

   $ tox -e bind -- --help playbooks
   ...
   custom options:
     --enough-no-create    Do not run the create step
     --enough-no-tests     Do not run the tests step
     --enough-no-destroy   Do not run the destroy step
   ...
   $ tests/run-tests.sh tox -e openvpn -- --enough-no-destroy playbooks/openvpn/tests

The domain name used for testing is in
`.pytest_cache/d/dotenough/bind.test/inventory/group_vars/all/domain.yml`,
where `bind` must be replaced by the name of the service. It is handy
for debugging (i.e. browsing the web interface of a service, ssh to a
machine that failed to run properly, etc.)

If a test fails, it will **not** destroy the resources provisioned
for the test, they must be destroyed explicitly with something like:

* ``tests/run-tests.sh tox -e openvpn -- --enough-no-create --enough-no-tests playbooks/openvpn/tests``

Upgrade testing
---------------

To verify that a service (`icinga` for instance) can be upgraded from
a given Enough version (`2.0.7` for instance), use:

::

   $ export ENOUGH_API_TOKEN=XXXXXXX
   $ source openrc.sh
   $ tests/run-tests.sh --upgrade 2.0.7 icinga
   ...

`run-tests.sh` performs the following steps:

* checkout the ``2.0.7``  tag into ``../infrastructure-versions/1.0.7/infrastructure``
* run ``tox -e icinga`` from the ``2.0.7`` directory and keep the hosts
* run ``tox -e icinga`` from the current version, re-using the hosts with the icinga version installed from ``2.0.7``

Debugging tests
---------------

Use ``--log-cli-level`` switch in order to both:

* enable log display during test run (live logging)
* control the test log level

For example:

::

  $ tests/run-tests.sh tox -e py3 -- --log-cli-level=INFO -s -x tests/enough/common/test_openstack.py

`--log-cli-level <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/logging.html#live-logs>`_ and following switches are `pytest ones <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contents.html>`_.

To execute only one test:

* ``tests/run-tests.sh tox -e py3 -- tests/enough/common/test_openstack.py::test_heat_definition``

Control-C won't work if you're trying to stop the tests, ``docker kill enough-tox`` should be used instead.

There should not be any leftover after a test involving OpenStack
fails, because the fixtures are supposed to thoroughly cleanup. But
bugs are to be expected in a test environment and it may be necessary
to manually remove leftovers, using the ``openstack`` command like so:

* ``tests/run-tests.sh env OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE=~/.enough/dev/inventory/clouds.yml openstack --os-cloud production stack list``
* ``tests/run-tests.sh env OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE=~/.enough/dev/clone-clouds.yml openstack --os-cloud production stack list``

In case leftover are manually deleted using ``stack delete`` command, the
following directory must be manually removed: ``.tox/<test environment>/.pytest_cache/``,
for example ``.tox/py3/.pytest_cache/``.

Execute Ansible on the test infrastructure
------------------------------------------

Display content of ``/path/to/a/file`` from ``bind-host`` when ``icinga``
test environment is used:

  ::

     $ tests/run-tests.sh .tox/icinga/bin/ansible bind-host \
        -i .tox/icinga/.pytest_cache/d/dotenough/icinga.test/inventory \
        -eansible_ssh_extra_args="'-i {{ ssh_private_keyfile }}'" \
        -mraw cat /path/to/a/file

Check the value of an ansible variable:

  ::

     $ tests/run-tests.sh .tox/icinga/bin/ansible bind-host \
        -i .tox/icinga/.pytest_cache/d/dotenough/icinga.test/inventory \
        -eansible_ssh_extra_args="'-i {{ ssh_private_keyfile }}'" \
        -m debug -avar=ansible_host

Ansible repository layout
-------------------------

The `ansible repository
<http://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/>`_ groups playbooks
and roles in separate directories to reduce the number of files to
consider when working on improving a playbook or a service.

* ``playbooks/authorized_keys``: distribute SSH public keys
* ``playbooks/backup``: daily VMs snapshots
* ``playbooks/bind``: DNS server and client
* ``playbooks/letsencrypt-nginx``: nginx reverse proxy with letsencrypt integration
* ``playbooks/icinga``: resources monitoring
* ``playbooks/infrastructure``: VMs creation and firewalling
* ``playbooks/postfix``: outgoing mail relay for all VMs
* etc.

The other scenarii found in the `playbooks` directory are services such
as `weblate <https://weblate.org/>`_ or `discourse <https://discourse.org/>`_.

The toplevel directory contains the `playbook that applies to the
enough.community production environment
<http://lab.enough.community/main/infrastructure/blob/master/enough-playbook.yml>`_. It
imports playbooks found in the `playbooks` directory.

Managing python dependencies
----------------------------

* adding a new dependency: `pipenv install thepackage`
* creating the requirements*.txt files needed to create a distribution: `pipenv run pipenv_to_requirements -f`
