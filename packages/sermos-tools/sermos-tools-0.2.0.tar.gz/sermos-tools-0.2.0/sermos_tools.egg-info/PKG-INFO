Description: # Sermos Tools
        
        Tool Catalog for use in Sermos applications.
        
        ## Philosophy
        
        There are countless tasks that take place in a typical 'data science enabled'
        workflow and many of them are *common*. Sermos Tools are intended to provide
        instant access to tooling that accomplishes those common tasks so you can move
        quickly and with confidence. A Sermos Tool has been tested in production, comes
        with specific python requirements and with a curated Docker environment to
        ensure the tool runs in a containerized environment (without you fighting with
        underlying system dependencies!).

        ## Testing
        
        Testing is a critical part of the Sermos Tools ecosystem. Every tool that is
        accepted into the production Tool Catalog must have appropriate tests with
        reasonable test coverage and hygeine.
        
        ### Run Tests
        
        To run the tests, ensure you've installed the `test` extras
        (`pip install -e .[test]`). Sermos currently supports Python 3.7+.
        
        Run tests for all tools:
        
            $ tox
        
        To run tests for one or more select tests, provide a comma-separated list of
        environment names, which match the name of the tools/{{dirname}}
        
            $ tox -e date_extractor,hasher
