        Pronounced like 'p' + 'isle'.
        
        An interface to a pronunciation dictionary with stress markings
        (ISLEX - the international speech lexicon),
        along with some tools for working with comparing and aligning
        pronunciations (e.g. a list of phones someone said versus a standard or
        canonical dictionary pronunciation).

        Documentation
        ================
        
        Automatically generated pdocs can be found here:
        
        http://timmahrt.github.io/pysle/
        
        
        Common Use Cases
        ================
        
        What can you do with this library?
        
        - look up the list of phones and syllables for canonical pronunciations
          of a word::
          
            isletool.LexicalTool('ISLEdict.txt').lookup('cat')
        
        - map an actual pronunciation to a dictionary pronunciation (can be used
          to automatically find speech errors)::
          
            pronunciationtools.findClosestPronunciation(isleDict, 'cat', ['k', 'æ',])
        
        - automatically syllabify a praat textgrid containing words and phones
          (e.g. force-aligned text) -- requires the
          `praatIO <https://github.com/timmahrt/praatIO>`_ library::
          
            pysle.syllabifyTextgrid(isleDict, praatioTextgrid, "words", "phones")
        
        - search for words based on pronunciation::
        
            isletool.LexicalTool('ISLEdict.txt').search('dVV') # Any word containing a 'd' followed by two vowels
        
            e.g. Words that start with a sound, or have a sound word medially, or
            in stressed vowel position, etc.
        
            see /tests/dictionary_search.py

        - The `praatIO <https://github.com/timmahrt/praatIO>`_ library is required IF 
          you want to use the textgrid functionality.  It is not required 
          for normal use.
        
        
        Optional resources
        ================
        
        pysle requires the ISLEdict pronunciation dictionary
        (copyright Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, licensed under the MIT open source license).
        This is bundled with psyle.  However, you may want to use a subset of the pronunciations
        or you may want to add your own pronunciations.
        
        In that case, please get the original file.
        
          `ISLEX github page <https://github.com/uiuc-sst/g2ps>`_
        
          `Direct link to the ISLEX file used in this project
          <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-sst/g2ps/master/English/ISLEdict.txt>`_ (ISLEdict.txt)
        
        See examples/isletool_examples.py for an example of how to load a custom ISLEdict file.
        
        
        Installation
        ================
        
        Pysle is on pypi and can be installed or upgraded from the command-line shell with pip like so::
        
            python -m pip install pysle --upgrade
        
        Otherwise, to manually install, after downloading the source from github, from a command-line shell, navigate to the directory containing setup.py and type::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        If python is not in your path, you'll need to enter the full path e.g.::
        
        	C:\Python36\python.exe setup.py install
        
        	
        Example usage
        ================
        
        Here is a typical common usage::
        
            from pysle import isletool
            isleDict = isletool.LexicalTool('C:\islev2.dict')
            print(isleDict.lookup('catatonic')[0]) # Get the first pronunciation
            >> (([['k', 'ˌæ'], ['ɾ', 'ə'], ['t', 'ˈɑ'], ['n', 'ɪ', 'k']], [2, 0], [1, 1]),)
        
        and another::
        
            from pysle import isletool
            from pysle import pronunciationtools
            
            isleDict = isletool.LexicalTool('C:\islev2.dict')
        
            searchWord = 'another'
            phoneList = ['n', '@', 'th', 'r'] # Actually produced (ASCII or IPA ok here)
        
            returnList = pronunciationtools.findBestSyllabification(isleDict, searchWord, phoneList)
            syllableList = returnList[2]
            print(syllableList)
            >> [["''"], ['n', '@'], ['th', 'r']]
            
        
        Please see \\examples for example usage
