Description: Provides helpful decorators for aws lambda handler functions.
        
        **@enable_logging**:
        Init logger with the level taken from _LOG_LEVEL_ environment variable.
         ```python
         @enable_logging
         def handle_event(event):
            logging.info('This will be logged, because the default level is INFO')
         ```
        
        **@process_sns_event**:
        Transforms the function into an sns event processor, meaning the function will be passed the extracted event payload.
         ```python
         @process_sns_event
         def handle_event(event):
            print(event['serial_number']) # event is the payload extracted from the original aws event
         ```
        
        **@process_sqs_event**:
        Transforms the function into an sqs command processor, meaning the function will be passed the extracted command payload.
         ```python
         @process_sqs_event
         def handle_event(command):
            print(command['serial_number']) # command is the payload extracted from the original aws event
         ```
        
        **@process_kinesis_event**:
        Transforms the function into a kinesis event processor, meaning the function will be passed the extracted event payload.
         ```python
         @process_kinesis_event
         def handle_event(event):
            print(event['serial_number']) # event is the payload extracted from the original aws event
         ```
