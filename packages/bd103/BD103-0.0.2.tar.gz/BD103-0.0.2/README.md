# BD103's Personal Coding Package
A bunch of random developer related functions and modules that I use.
## Patch Notes
### 0.0.2
Emptied `__init__.py` to fix error. Updated `setup.py` and redid `README.md`.
### 0.0.1
Initial package. Used a sample color formatting package that I made.
```python
''' Functions '''
color(text, color) # Prints with text then resets formatting
paint(color) # Sets color permanently until reset

''' Colors '''
reset = "reset
red = "red"
yellow = "yellow"
green = "green"
cyan = "cyan"
blue = "blue"
magenta = "magenta"
black = "black"
white = "white"
```
