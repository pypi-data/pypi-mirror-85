# Animal Sounds

## An Example NetBox Plugin

This package is provided as an example plugin for NetBox. It is intended to function as a reference point for authors creating their own plugins and provides no useful functionality on its own. Please see [the NetBox documentation](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins/) for more information about the plugins framework.

### Why Animals?

Animals were chosen as the focus point for this example plugin to clearly distinguish the plugins framework from the plugin itself. Any components relating to an animal or sound obviously stand out as demonstrative code, allowing the reader to focus on the framework components.
