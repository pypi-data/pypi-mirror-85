# EI Library

A Python library to support reading/writing binary files of the Evil Islands game formats.

Currently it supports only databases format (`*.udb`, `*.idb`, ...). But in the near future,
I plan to add support for the formats of archives (`*.res`) and maps (`*.mob`, `*.mpr`).

## Disclaimer

This library is at a very early stage of development, and its current state is far from perfect.

## Thanks

Thanks to these projects for the information I used in my library.
