Description: # What is TOPSIS
        
        TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is one of the numerical methods of the multi-criteria decision making. This is a broadly applicable method with a simple mathematical model.It chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution, and greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution.
        
        # To Install the package use
        
        ```
        pip install TOPSIS-DILREET-101803048==1.0.2
        ```
        
        # To Run the package use :
        
        ```
        cd TOPSIS-DILREET-101803048
        python topsis.py data.csv 1,1,1,2 +,+,-,+ result.csv
        ```
        
        # The format is
        
        topsis <InputDataFile> <Weights> <Impacts> <ResultFileName>
        
        ## Steps used in TOPSIS
        
        1)Normalize the given decision data
        2)Find weighted normalized
        3)Determine positive ideal and negative ideal solution
        4)Calculate separation measures
        5)Find relative closesness to ideal solution
        6)Rank the preference order
