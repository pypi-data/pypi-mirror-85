        Simple Python module for Multiple Criteria Decision Making System using TOPSIS.
        
        Input/Output Files:
        
        Input File: Input file contain three or more columns. First column is the object/variable name (e.g. M1, M2, M3, M4â€¦...). The input file from 2nd to last columns contain numeric values only
