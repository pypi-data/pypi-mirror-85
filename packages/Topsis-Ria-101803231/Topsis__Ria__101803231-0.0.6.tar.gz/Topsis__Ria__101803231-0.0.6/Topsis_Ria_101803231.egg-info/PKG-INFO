        About
        -----
        
        TOPSIS is the method that is based on finding an ideal and an anti-ideal
        solution and comparing the distance of each one of the alternatives to
        those.
        
        To get started quickly, just use the following:
        
        ``` {.bash}
        from Topsis_package.topsis import topsis
        topsis('inputfilename','Weights','Impacts','Outputfilename')
        ```
        
        make ensure the weights and impacts should be in ""
        
        eg: "1,1,1,1" and "+,-,+,-"
        
        Pre-requisite
