**Before making a bug report, please check that you are able to run the code snippet below with no errors. It should display a window with a button. If this doesn't work, your problem with with PyQt5 and not PandasGUI specifically (and in that case I recommend you try reinstalling `PyQt5`, `PyQtWebEngine`, and `PyQt5-sip`)**

**Also make sure you're still able to reproduce the bug with the latest release (run `pip install --upgrade pandasgui`).**

```
from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets, QtWebEngineWidgets, sip
app = QtWidgets.QApplication([])
test = QtWidgets.QPushButton("test")
test.show()
app.exec_()
```
