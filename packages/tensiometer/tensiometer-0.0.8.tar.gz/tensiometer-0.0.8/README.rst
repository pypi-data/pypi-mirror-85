Description
============

The tensiometer package is a collection of tools that extends `GetDist <https://pypi.org/project/GetDist/>`_ capabilities
to test the level of agreement/disagreement between different posterior distributions.

The best way to get up to speed is to read through the worked example
`full worked example <https://tensiometer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tension_example.html>`_
that you can `run online <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mraveri/tensiometer/master?filepath=docs%2Fexample_notebooks%2Ftension_example.ipynb>`_!

Installation
=============

The tensiometer package is available on PyPI and can be easily installed with::

  pip install tensiometer

Alternatively one can download the source code from github::

  git clone https://github.com/mraveri/tensiometer.git

and install with::

  python setup.py install

You can test that the code is working properly by using::

  make test

Dependencies
=============
* Python 3.6+
* matplotlib 2.2+ (3.1+ recommended)
