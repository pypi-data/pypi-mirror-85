Description: ## IOT Client - Python
        
        IOT is taking over world, many electronics device connect together on a network and communicate to each other.
        I have build app that helps you to connect those microcontroller together. Below are the client details.
        
        Before going further this project is strongly meant for controlling robots over internet, you can check out more on <a href="https://iorresearch.ml">Project Website</a>
        
        Currently it has been tested on:
            Arduino, Lego Mindstroms EV3 Brick and on a Raspberry PI 3
            other tests are being done.
        
        This is git repository for  the python client:
        
        ## Installation
        Run the following command
        
            pip install --upgrade ior-research
         
        ## Usage
        
            token = "paste your subscription key here"
            code = int("current device code here")
            to = int("Destiation device code here")
        
            time_delay = 90 # Time delay for the heart beat (in seconds) default is 90 seconds
        
        ## Create Instance of IOT Client
        
            from ior_research.IOTClient import IOTClient
            iot = IOTClient(from = code,to=to,token=token) #Creating object for IOT Client
        
        ### Setting up Receive Function to do some Operation when a response is received.
        
            iot.set_on_receive(lambda x: print(x))
        
        ### Last but not the least start the IOTClient
        
            iot.start()
            iot.join() #Since IOTClient inherites Thread Class you can also use .join() function depending on your use case
