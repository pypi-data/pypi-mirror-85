Description: 
        NRSur7dq2 is a surrogate model for gravitational waves from numerical
        relativity simulations of binary black hole mergers.
        It is described in Blackman et al. 2017:
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07089
        https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.96.024058
        
        This package provides a class NRSurrogate7dq2 for evaluating the NRSur7dq2
        surrogate model.
        
        See the NRSurrogate7dq2 class docstring for usage.
