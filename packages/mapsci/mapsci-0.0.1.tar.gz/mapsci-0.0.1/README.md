MAPSCI: Multipole Approach of Predicting and Scaling Cross Interactions

**WARNING!** This package is not ready for distribution.

What is this?
-------------
MAPSCI is an importable package that can be used to estimate cross-interaction parameters for the Mie potential using multipole moments. This is useful for the SAFT-𝛾-Mie equation of state, as well as Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation methods.

How do I use it?
----------------
Once installed, you can:
 * Import the package and use it in a python script. Note that the parameters are temperature dependent.
 * This package can be used as a plug-in for our equation of state package, [DESPASITO](https://github.com/jaclark5/despasito). You won't need to worry about temperature dependence in this case, it'll be taken care of internally.
Check out our [documentation](https://mapsci.readthedocs.io) for more information.

Installation
------------
**NOTE:** Coming soon to pip

Download the master branch from our github page as a zip file, or clone it with git via ``git clone https://github.com/jaclark5/mapsci`` in your working directory. Install MAPSCI locally from the working directory with ``python setup.py install --user``.
