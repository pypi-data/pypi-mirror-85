Description: # Honesty
        
        There's a long tail of people doing interesting/sketchy things to packages on
        pypi.  Most aren't malicious, but this project gives you an easy way to check
        for some of the obvious ways that packages might be tampered with.
        
        # Usage
        
        ```
        honesty list <package name>
        honesty check <package name>[==version|==*] [--verbose]
        honesty download <package name>[==version|==*] [--dest=some-path/]
        honesty extract <package name>[==version|==*] [--dest=some-path/]
        honesty license <package name>[==version|==*]
        
        (provisional)
        honesty ispep517 <package name>[==version|==*]
        honesty native <package name>[==version|==*]
        honesty age <package name>[==version|==*]
        honesty deps [--flat|--pick] <package name>[==version|==*]
        ```
        
        It will store a package cache, using the normal appdirs package to pick a
        location (on Linux, this defaults to `~/.cache/honesty/pypi` but, you can
        override with `XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `HONESTY_CACHE` environment variables).
        
        If you have a local bandersnatch, specify `HONESTY_INDEX_URL` to your `/simple/`
        url.  It also must support `/pypi/<package>/json` or pass `--nouse-json` to the
        commands that support it.
        
        
        # Exit Status of 'check'
        
        These are bit flags to make sense when there are multiple problems.  If you pass
        `*` for version, they are or'd together.
        
        ```
        0   if only sdist or everything matches
        1   if only bdist
        2   (reserved for future "extraction error")
        4   some .py from bdist not in sdist
        8   some .py files present with same name but different hash in sdist (common
            when using versioneer or 2to3)
        ```
        
        
        # API
        
        The user-facing API is intended to be used to analyze metadata and download
        sdists.  It is somewhat provisional, in that the exceptions raised are not
        well-defined.
        
        ```
        from honesty.cache import Cache
        from honesty.releases import async_parse_index
        from honesty.api import async_download_one
        async def foo(pkgname, pkgversion):
          with Cache() as c:
              pkg = await async_parse_index(pkgname, c, use_json=True)
              path = async_download_one(pkg, pkgversion, cache=c)
        ```
