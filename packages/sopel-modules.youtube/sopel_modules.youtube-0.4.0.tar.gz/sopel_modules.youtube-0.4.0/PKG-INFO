        YouTube info plugin for Sopel
        
        ## Installing
        
        If possible, use `pip` to install this plugin. Below are example commands; you
        might need to add `sudo` and/or call a different `pip` (e.g. `pip3`) depending
        on your system and environment. Do not use `setup.py install`; Sopel won't be
        able to load the plugin correctly.
        
        ### Published release
        
            pip install sopel_modules.youtube
        
        ### From source
        
            # Clone the repo, then run this in /path/to/sopel-youtube
            pip install .
        
        ## Getting your API key
        Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
        and create an application. When it's created, go to the APIs section, select
        the YouTube Data API and enable it. Then go to the Credentials section,
        select "Add credentials", pick "API key", and then "Server key". You can enter
        a name for it and limit the IPs it can be used from, but you don't have to.
        Copy the value it gives you into the prompt in the config wizard, or the
        `api_key` value of the config in the `[youtube]` section.
        
        ## Config settings
        `sopel-youtube` supports Sopel's interactive configuration wizard:
        
            sopel-plugins configure youtube
        
        The `api_key` option is self-explanatory (see above).
        
        If video "watch" links contain a playlist ID, the plugin will show the
        playlist info as well as the video info by default. To disable this, set
        `playlist_watch` to `False`.
        
        For videos, by default, only the video length, uploader (channel name), view
        count, and upload date are shown. The included items, and the order in which
        they appear, depend on the `info_items` setting, which is a list of keywords.
        Unrecognized keywords are simply ignored. Supported `info_items` are:
        
        * `comments` (comment count)
        * `date` (upload time/date)
        * `length` (duration)
        * `uploader` (channel name)
        * `views` (view count)
        * `votes_color` or `votes` (likes/dislikes, with or without IRC formatting)
