Description: # TOPSIS-suryansh-101983044
        This python module aims to implement Multiple Criteria Decision Making using TOPSIS ranking.
        The module is available at https://pypi.org/project/TOPSIS-suryansh-101983044/0.1/.
        ## Description
        This module basically is a function which requires a CSV file as input which contains the model on which you wish to implement TOPSIS  along with impacts,weights and a name for the result file.The model basically builts a result csv file which has two additional columns, TOPSIS score and rank respectively. 
        ## Installation
        Use package manager pip to install the module.
        #### Code :
        pip install TOPSIS-suryansh-101983044
        
        ## Usage
        After intalling the package use the following code:
        
        #### Code example:
        module =__import__('TOPSIS-suryansh-101983044')
        module.topsis(file_name,weights,impacts,resultant_filename)
        
        #### Usage Contsraints
        The  first attribute is a string containg the name of the input csv file.It should contain the input model and should be present in the working directory.
        ###### * It should have more than 3 columns.
        ###### * First column is the object/variable name.
        ###### * From 2nd to last columns contain numeric values only.
        
        The second attribute is a string containing comma seperated weights.
        Example: "1,1,1,1" 
        ###### * Weights should be numerical and should be separated by commas.
        
        The third attribute is a string containing comma seperated impacts.
        Example: "+,-,-,+"
        ###### * Impacts could either be '+' or '-'. Impacts should be comma separated.
        
        ###### * Number of WEIGHTS and IMPACTS must be equal to the number of COLUMNS(excluding the first object column) in the input file
