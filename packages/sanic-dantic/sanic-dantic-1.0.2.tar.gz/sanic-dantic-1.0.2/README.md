sanic-parsedargs is a request parameter checking and parsing library based on pydantic under the sanic framework

It is based on pydantic, which can facilitate developers to quickly check and obtain request parameters

## Installation
```shell
pip install sanic-dantic

```

## Usage
Before writing all the examples, let's write a server.py first. In all examples, we will focus on the use of views and no longer write extraneous peripheral code.
