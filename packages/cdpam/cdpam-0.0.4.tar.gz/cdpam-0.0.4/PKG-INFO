        This is a Pytorch implementation of our new and improved audio perceptual metric. It contains (0) minimal code to run our perceptual metric (CDPAM).
        
        ## (0) Usage as a loss function
        
        ### Minimal basic usage as a distance metric
        
        Running the command below takes two audio files as input and gives the perceptual distance between the files. It should return (approx)**distance = 0.1696**. Some GPU's are non-deterministic, and so the distance could vary in the lsb.
        
        Installing the metric (CDPAM - perceptual audio similarity metric)
        ```bash
        pip install cdpam
        ```
        
        Using the metric is as simple as: 
        ```bash
        import cdpam
        loss_fn = cdpam.DPAM()
        wav_ref = cdpam.load_audio('sample_audio/ref.wav')
        wav_out = cdpam.load_audio('sample_audio/2.wav')
        
        dist = loss_fn.forward(wav_ref,wav_out)
        ```
