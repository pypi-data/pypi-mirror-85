.RB [ \-\-help "] [" \-\-about "] [" \-\-daemon "] [" \-\-verbose "] [" \-\-list_commands "] [" \-\-list_params "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ups-daemon
With no options specified, the utility will give the current status of the UPS configured with \fBdaemon = true\fR
in the
.ul
ups-config.json
file. With the \fB--daemon\fR option, \fBups-daemon\fR will continuously check the status
of the UPS.  When it detects that the UPS is sourcing powering from the battery, it will check the amount of time
it has been running on battery and run the specified suspend script when the specified threshold is exceeded.  It
will execute the specified resume script when it detects power has resumed.  When the utility detects a Battery
Low event from the UPS or that time remaining for battery or the battery charge is below specified thresholds,
then the shutdown script will be executed. If \fBups-daemon\fR detects a return to line power has occurred before
the shutdown has completed, it will execute the cancel shutdown script.  With the \fB--list_commands\fR option, the
utility will list all available SNMP commands for the configured UPS.  With the \fB--list_params\fR option, the
daemon configuration parameters will be listed. The \fB--logfile LOGFILE\fR option is used to specify a logfile,
but is not implemented at this time.  The threshold and script definitions must be made in the
.ul
ups-utils.ini
file using
.ul
ups-utils.ini.template
as a template.
