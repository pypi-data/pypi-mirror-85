.SH NAME
ups-utils.ini \- defines required directory paths, script names, and script parameters

.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.ul
ups-utils.ini
contains the definitions of parameters critical to the functioning of \fBups-utils\fR. A
template for the creation of this file is provided in the distribution package as
.ul
ups-utils.ini.template
and should be used as a base for creating a usable
.ul
ups-utils.ini
file.

.TP
\fBFirst section defines path names:\fR
These path names are required in order to access scripts
defined in the second section.  When using \fBups-utils\fR to manage a machine running BOINC,
\fBboinc_home\fR must define the location of root of BOINC where executables are located.

\fBboinc_home\fR = /home/boinc/BOINC/

.TP
\fBSecond section defines script names:\fR
There are 4 scripts that need to be defined which are meant
to suspend high power usage jobs when on battery or overloading the batter and to resume them when power
returns.  A shutdown script is defined for when the battery level is critical and a cancel shutdown script
is used if power is recovered before shutdown completes.

.RE

.TP
\fBThird section defines ups-utility parameters:\fR
These parameters are in pairs with the read_interval specifying both \fBups-monitor\fR and \fBups-daemon\fR
read intervals in seconds. The remaining UPS related parameters specify critical and warning levels used by
both \fBups-monitor\fR and \fBups-daemon\fR. The \fBups-monitor\fR utility will color relevant items
red/yellow when tripping critical/warning levels. If running, \fBups-daemon --daemon\fR, will decrease
update interval for \fBthreshold_battery_time_rem\fR or \fBthreshold_battery_capacity\fR reaching warning
level and execute \fBshutdown_script\fR if critical level is reached.  For \fBthreshold_time_on_battery\fR
and \fBthreshold_battery_load\fR, the \fBsuspend_script\fR will be executed on tripping critical limit.

.SH "FILES"
.TP
.ul
ups-utils.ini
This file is used to define required directory paths, script names, and script parameters.
.TP
.ul
ups-config.json
This file is used to define ups communication parameters for all UPSs intended to be monitored.

.SH "FILE LOCATIONS"
.TP
.nr step 1 1
The configuration files of \fBrickslab-ups-utils\fR can be located in 3 possible locations and are
selected with the following order of priority:
.RS 7
.IP \n[step] 3
repository directory  - Chosen only if executed from repository directory.
.IP \n+[step]
/usr/share/rickslab-ups-utils/config/  -  Used with install from debian package.  In this case, file
permissions and group ownership must be managed.  The
.ul
ups-utils.ini
contains sensitive information, snmp shared secret, and should be readable only by root and a group
who's members are trusted with this secret.  It is suggested to create a upsutils group and add
trusted members and then chgrp of
.ul
ups-utils.ini
to this new group.  You must finally change permissions to be readable and writeable by only group
and root (660).

.IP \n+[step]
~/share/rickslab-ups-utils/config/   -  Used with pip install, if above is not available.
