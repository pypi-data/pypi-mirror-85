    <description>
      Value passed to Python's sys.setcheckinterval() function.

      This integer value determines how often the interpreter checks
      for periodic things such as thread switches and signal handlers.
      Setting it to a larger value may increase performance for
      programs using threads.  Setting it to a value &lt;= 0 checks every
      virtual instruction, maximizing responsiveness as well as
      overhead.

  <key name="threads" datatype="integer" default="4">
    <description>
      The number of threads which should be used to serve requests.

      The threads are placed in a pool and are used to serve requests
      received from the servers configured using &lt;server&gt;
      sections.  This does not constrain the total number of threads
      used by the application server; additional threads may be used
      for internal purposes.
