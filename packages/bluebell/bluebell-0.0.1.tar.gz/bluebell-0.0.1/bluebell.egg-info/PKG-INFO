Description: # bluebell
        
        `bluebell` is a Python package for estimating the uncertainties of
        parameters in least-squares problems by computing minimum-volume
        bounding ellipsoids (MVBEs). Given a set of points *x* at which some
        *χ²* has been evaluated, `bluebell` computes the uncertainties on the
        points *x* by computing the MVBE around the points, moved by their
        values of *χ²* such that, if the problem is exactly linear, all the
        points lie on the same ellipsoid.
        
        Install `bluebell` from PyPI with
        
            python -m pip install bluebell
