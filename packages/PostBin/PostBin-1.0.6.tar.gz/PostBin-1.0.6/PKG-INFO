Description: # PostBin
        A simple package that allows you to post to haste services.
        
        ## Features:
        * "fallback" system, meaning your pastes always succeed
        * async and sync functionality
        * literally instant setup - see [execution](#Execution)
        
        ## Why this exists
        There's no real need for a full-fledged module for simply creating pastes. So, I think a quick 2 function module
        does the trick far easier.
        
        ## Installing
        from pip: 
        ```shell script
        $ [python3 -m] pip install postbin
        ```
        or from git:
        ```shell script
        $ [python3 -m] pip install git+https://github.com/dragdev-studios/PostBin.git
        ```
        
        ## Execution
        from within a script:
        ```python
        import postbin
        # Async app
        async def main():
            url = await postbin.postAsync(f"FooBar Bazz")
            print(f"Your paste is located at {url}")
        
        
        # Sync app
        def mainSync():
            url = postbin.postSync(f"FooBar Bazz 2")
            print(f"Your paste is located at {url}")
        ```
        
        ## Want your haste service to be a fallback?
        Just open an issue, with the URL, and we'll add it!
