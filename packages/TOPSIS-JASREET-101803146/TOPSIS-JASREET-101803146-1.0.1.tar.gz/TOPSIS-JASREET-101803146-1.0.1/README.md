## About
TOPSIS is an acronym that stands for 'Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution' and is a pretty straightforward MCDA method. As the name implies, the method is based on finding an ideal and an anti-ideal solution and comparing the distance of each one of the alternatives to those

To get started quickly, just use the following:

```bash
from topis_pckg.topsis import topsis
topsis('inputfilename','Weights','Impacts','Outputfilename')
```
make ensure the weights and impacts should be in "" 

eg: "1,1,1,1" and "+,-,+,-"

## Pre-requisite
The data should be enclosed in the csv file. There must be more than 2 columns


## Result
the output(outputfilename)  is saved in the project folder with extra 2 columns with topsis score and rank.
