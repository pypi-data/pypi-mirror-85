        =====
        
        FidusWriter-PHPList is a Fidus writer plugin to connect a Fidus Writer instance
        with an email list using PHPList. It allows users signing up on the Fidus Writer instance to also sign up for the email list.
        
        
        Installation
        -----------
        
        1. Install PHPList 3.X if you haven't done so already. Install Fidus Writer with the command:
        
            pip install fiduswriter[phplist]
        
        2. Create an email list within PHPList if you don't have one already. Take note of the list ID.
        
        3. Within PHPList, install the REST API plugin.
        
        4. Setup an admin user with access rights to manage subscriber lists within PHPList.
        
        5. Add "phplist" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting in the configuration.py file
           like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                ...
                'phplist',
            )
        
        6. Add these settings to configuration.py::
        
            PHPLIST_BASE_URL # The URL of your PHPList installation
            PHPLIST_LOGIN # The PHPList user's username created in step 4
            PHPLIST_PASSWORD # The PHPList user's password created in step 4
            PHPLIST_SECRET (optional) # If you have set an obligatory secret within the PHPLIst REST API, set it here as well.
            PHPLIST_LIST_ID # The email list id found in step 2.
        
        7. (Re)start your Fidus Writer server.
