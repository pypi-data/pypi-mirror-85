- When pages mentions linked files they are downloaded and added together with the HTML page itself
  to a new one level deeper sub-folder of the same name as the original HTML page. Files located in this folder
  may fail to follow the same structure as it does in the Other Files folder. Fik this by making sub-folders
  mentioned in the File objects info dictionary.
