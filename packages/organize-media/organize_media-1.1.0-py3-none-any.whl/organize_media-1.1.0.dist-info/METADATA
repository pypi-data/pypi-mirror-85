# Organize Media (photos and videos)

---------------

This application writes, inside an input existing directory , one directory list where the videos and photos are copied and organized in subdirectories following the year of creation, month of creation and topic.
In detail:
* I declared a ( relative or absolute) path where there are the videos and photos organized in subdirectories ('topic') and another path where writing the copied files
* The application writes the directories and subdirectories of they don't exist, otherwise they are not modified
* The structure of the final directories is based on the extension and the topic of the files


## Features

### Future
* In copying the files, every directory also will have a CSV file (different from media type) with the list of the files and the data (this feature will remove the **-w** flag in input)
* Package the project
* use the internal logging in python
* add the control that *draft-tag* must has'nt not more than 100 row
* create the specific file for Shutterstock: ( I put the filename, description and tags in different rows)
* Using *chain of command* design pattern
* Create one file *draft-tag-* for every image or video, in the list I create the *selected-tags* and after, into *join* phase, for every file I'm looking for the specific file tag, I read this and I join in the final file
* Before writing the tags, I control that the rows have'nt it
* When I create the final file CSV to upload, I have to create more than 1, so I can upload in batch way
* Create directroy *realtime* and *timelapse* in directory di *copy* phase

### Next
* write the file *Contribuing* like [this](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426/forks)

### Running


### Past

* Organize the code: there are classes into directory test ( sistemare gli import nella directory organizemedia )
* use travis for CI
* delete class *AsString*
* fix the style in the modules
* put classes with the tests in *tests* package and classes with no tests in *src* package, where there are only the classes without the tests


## Bug

### Future
* Fix the unit test
* fix the Test Suite
* Resolve the TODO in the code
* Organize the structure following the guidelines in[The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python!](https://docs.python-guide.org/)
* Delete the test classes where it s *import date* or *import datetime*
* Create directories *exported* and *original* in *topic* in *copy* command
* review the system of the calculation of the more important tags

### Next
* Write defensive class to manage the input parameters
