```python
>>> from github_contributions import GithubUser
>>> user = GithubUser('bcongdon')
>>> print(user.contributions().today())
Day(date=datetime.date(2017, 7, 15), count=2, level=1)
```

## Installation

```sh
$ pip install githubcontributions
$ python
>>> import github_contributions
```

## Why github_contributions?

The Github Data API does not provide data on the contribution graphs for users. While you can get fine-grained details on the stats of specific repositories, there is not currently an API for a user's overall contributions.

Calculating a user's contributions by aggregating their repositories is expensive, and can require a prohibitive number of API calls. `github_contributions` can fetch an entire year of contribution data in 1 request.

`github_contributions` exposes user contribution data (i.e. the sum of commits, issues created, and PRs reviewed per day), and also exposes Github's 'contribution level' data (the colors displayed on the contribution graph).

## Basic Usage

### Getting a User's Contribution History

``` python
from github_contributions import GithubUser

user = GithubUser('bcongdon')
contribs = user.contributions()

print(contribs.days[0])
# Day(date=datetime.date(2016, 7, 10), count=6, level=1)

contribs_2016 = user.contributions(start_date='2016-01-01', end_date='2016-12-31')
print(sum([day.count for day in contribs_2016.days]))
# 1509
```

### Getting a User's Current Streak
``` python
from github_contributions import GithubUser

user = GithubUser('bcongdon')
streak = user.current_streak()
print(len(streak))
# 501

print(streak[0].date)
# 2016-03-02)
```

### Getting a User's Past Streaks
``` python
from github_contributions import GithubUser

user = GithubUser('sindresorhus')
contributions = user.contributions()
streaks = contributions.streaks()

print(len(streaks))
# 30

print(streaks[-1][0].date)
# 2017-07-15
```
