# Install

Install {(app.name)} using Helm:

```
helm install --name {(helm.name)} {(helm.name)}-{(app.version)}.tgz
```

Add configuration through a custom Helm values file:

```
touch custom-values.yaml
```

Add configuration to this file (check [Helm Configuration](#helm-configuration) and [Application Configuration)[#app-configuration] for details of the properties that may be configured):

```
app:
  config:
    override:
      connection_address: foundation-kafka:9092
```

Reference the values file on install to apply configuration:

```
helm install --name {(helm.name)} {(helm.name)}-{(app.version)}.tgz -f custom_values.yaml-
```

Once the pod for the driver has started you will be able to access the Swagger UI at: `http://<kubernetes-node-ip>:{(helm.node_port)}/api/driver/ui`
