Description: # Spelling words like AI
        
        
        This project is inspired from a popular meme which consisted of will AI systems count numbers. For eg:
        
        1999 - Nineteen Ninty Nine
        
        1888 - Eighteen Eighty Eight
        
        1111 - Eleven Eleven,
        
        No guys, AI is more cooler. It's  => **Oneteen Onety One**
        
        This actually is one of the Rules of Machine Learning, ie 
        
        Rule #7: Turn heuristics into features, or handle them externally.
