LightParse
==========

Light to use argument parser for cli tools. This is basically reinventing a
wheel, but argparse felt cumbersome to use and some other options I looked up
didn't seem attractive to me either. So, I decided to make a new one with the
goal that I wouldn't need to sacrifice anything even when writing a really
small script that could just index sys.argv.
