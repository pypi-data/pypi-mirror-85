# things todo for openpiv


+ add new dynamic masking to preprocess.py

+ documentation / tutorials / web site
    
    This is always needed to improve. New users 
    should rapidly understand what OpenPiv is capable of. They
    should feel as comfortable as possible on the first `impact`.
    

+ hdf5 output

    Writing data to an hdf5 file can be easily done if we do not use 
    multiprocessing. If this is the case, it is much more work and learing.
    
    So basically it would be a first step to: it would be easy for me
    (davide) to create a class in openpiv.tools named something like
    hdf_database_creator which accept a list of files, reads them and save
    data to a single big hdf5 file.
    
+ a module for post processing.
    i have some Object oriented code available at 
    
    http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~lasagnadavide/+junk/PyFlow/view/head:/pyflow/field.py
    
    which already does simple stuff.
    
    Maybe we can start from there.
