Description: # Conan Center Bot
        
        This is a library to help update recipes in conan-center-index.
        
        The library will scan a conan-center-index repository as well as
        all recipes's upstream to try to find which recipes can be updated.
        
        It can then either generates the list of updatable recipes, or
        automatically update a recipe to the latest upstream version.
        
        This library is used to keep https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues/3470
        and https://github.com/qchateau/conan-center-bot/issues/1 up to date.
        
        ## How to use it

        ```
        python -m ccb -h
        ```
        
        ### Update a recipe
        
        ```
        usage: main.py update [-h] [--verbose] [--cci CCI] [--force] [--push] [--no-test] recipe [recipe ...]
        
        positional arguments:
          recipe         List of recipes to update.
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help     show this help message and exit
          --verbose, -v  Verbosity level
          --cci CCI      Path to the conan-center-index repository. Defaults to '../conan-center-index'
          --force        Overwrite the branch if it exists, force push if the remote branch exists.
          --push         Push the new branch to origin
          --no-test      Do not test the updated recipe
        ```
        
        To auto-update and test a recipe, run
        
        ```bash
        python3 main.py update <recipe-name> --push --cci <path-to-cci>
        ```
        
        After you ran the script:
        
        - Verify and maybe tweak the diff in the new branch
        - Open a PR on CCI
        
        ## Limitations
        
        - Only projects on GitHub are supported.
        - Some versioning patterns are too specific to be supported.
        - Recipes require a config.yml file.
