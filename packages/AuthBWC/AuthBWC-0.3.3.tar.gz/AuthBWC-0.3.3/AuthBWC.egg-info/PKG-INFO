        Introduction
        ---------------
        
        AuthBWC is a component for `BlazeWeb <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/BlazeWeb/>`_
        applications.  It provides users, groups, permissions, related helpers
        and views.  Proper integration of this component will allow applications to have
        views that can only be accessed by certain users.
        
        Includes email notifications when an account is created as well as an email
        based password reset mechanism.

          were loaded.  This vulnerability made it possible for a user to gain the

          to be sharing the same http session for this access to have been
          gained.
