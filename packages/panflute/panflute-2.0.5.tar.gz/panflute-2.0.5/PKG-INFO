        [panflute](http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/) is a Python package that makes creating Pandoc filters fun.
        
        For a detailed user guide, documentation, and installation instructions, see
        <http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/>.

        You might also find useful [this presentation](https://github.com/BPLIM/Workshops/raw/master/BPLIM2019/D2_S1_Sergio_Correia_Markdown.pdf) on how I use markdown+pandoc+panflute to write research papers (at the Banco de Portugal 2019 Workshop on Reproductible Research).
        
        
        ## Install
        
        To install panflute, open the command line and type:
        
        ```bash
        pip install panflute
        ```
        
        ## Uninstall
        
        ```bash
        pip uninstall panflute
        ```
        
        ## Dev Install
        
        After cloning the repo and opening the panflute folder:
        
        `python setup.py install`: installs the package locally
        
        `python setup.py develop`: installs locally with a symlink so changes are automatically updated
        
        ## Note on versions
        
        panflute 1.12 or above dropped support of Python 2. When using Python 3, depending on your setup, you may need to use `pip3`/`python3` explicitly. If you need to use panflute in Python 2, install panflute 1.11.x or below.
        
        Currently supported Python versions: [![Python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/panflute.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/panflute/). Check `setup.py` for details, which further indicates support of pypy on top of CPython.
        
        ### Supported pandoc versions
        
        pandoc versioning semantics is [MAJOR.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH](https://pvp.haskell.org) and panflute's is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Below we shows matching versions of pandoc that panflute supports, in descending order. Only major version is shown as long as the minor versions doesn't matter.
        
        <!-- For pandoc API verion, check https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc for pandoc-types, which is the same thing. -->
        
        | panflute version  | supported pandoc versions | supported pandoc API versions |
        | ---   | ---   |  ---  |
        | 2.0 | 2.11.0.4—2.11.x  | 1.22    |
        | not supported | 2.10  | 1.21  |
        | 1.12 | 2.7-2.9 | 1.17.5–1.20  |
        
        Note: pandoc 2.10 is short lived and 2.11 has minor API changes comparing to that, mainly for fixing its shortcomings. Please avoid using pandoc 2.10.
