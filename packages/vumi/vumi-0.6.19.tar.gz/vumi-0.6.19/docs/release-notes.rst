Release Notes
=============

Version 0.6
-----------

NOTE: Version 0.6.x is backward-compatible with 0.5.x for the most part, with
some caveats. The first few releases will be removing a bunch of obsolete and
deprecated code and replacing some of the internals of the base worker. While
this will almost certainly not break the majority of things built on vumi, old
code or code that relies too heavily on the details of worker setup may need to
be fixed.

:Version: 0.6.13
:Date released: 10 January 2017

* Ensure that the keys for the data coding mapping of the SMPP transport get
  converted to ints, as it's not possible with Junebug's JSON channel config to
  represent dictionary keys as integers.
* Update Message Sender tests to work with the new Riak client.

:Version: 0.6.12
:Date released: 23 September 2016

* Update the HttpRPCTransport to use the new vumi logging to be compatible with
  Junebug log collection.

:Version: 0.6.11
:Date released: 12 August 2016

* Change logging level from warning to info for SMPP disconnections, to reduce
  sentry entries when being throttled.

:Version: 0.6.10
:Date released: 27 July 2016

* Update Dmark transport to send null content at the start of a USSD session
  rather than sending the USSD code.

:Version: 0.6.9
:Date released: 27 July 2016

* Apply numerous cleanups to the Dockerfile.
* Use only decimal digits for session identifiers in the MTN Nigeria USSD
  XML over TCP transport.
* Add the ability to configure the PDU field the dialed USSD code is taken
  from in the 6D SMPP processor.
* Update tests to pass with Twisted 16.3.

:Version: 0.6.8
:Date released: 12 May 2016

* Allow disabling of delivery report handling as sometimes these cause more noise
  than signal.
* Embed the original SMPP transports delivery report status into the message
  transport metadata. This is useful information that applications may chose
  to act on.

:Version: 0.6.7
:Date released: 19 April 2016

* Re-fix the bug in the Vumi Bridge transport that prevents it making outbound
  requests.

  tearing down the Redis manager and successfully tearing down even if start up
  failed halfway).
* Add support for older SSL CA certificates when using the Vumi Bridge
  transport to connect to Vumi Go.

:Version: 0.6.4
:Date released: 8 April 2016

  Redis implementations.

:Version: 0.6.1
