Description: # Privacy Accounting
        
        This directory contains tools for tracking privacy budgets. Currently, it
        provides an implementation of Privacy Loss Distributions (PLDs) which can
        help compute an accurate estimate of the total ε, δ across multiple executions
        of differentially private queries. Our implementation currently supports Laplace
        Mechanism, Gaussian Mechanism and Randomized Response. A supplementary material
        with more detailed definitions and references can be found
        [here](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy/tree/main/common_docs/Privacy_Loss_Distributions.pdf).
