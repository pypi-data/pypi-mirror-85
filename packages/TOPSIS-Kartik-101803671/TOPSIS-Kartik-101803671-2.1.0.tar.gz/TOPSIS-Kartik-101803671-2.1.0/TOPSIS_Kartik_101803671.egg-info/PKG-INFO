Description: # topsis
        It is a Python package to find out the best value among the different data using the mathematical calculations.
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install this package.
        
        ```bash

        ```
        
        ## About
        TOPSIS is an acronym that stands for 'Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution' and is a pretty straightforward MCDA method. As the name implies, the method is based on finding an ideal and an anti-ideal solution and comparing the distance of each one of the alternatives to those
        
        To get started quickly, just use the following:
        
        ```bash
        from topis_pckg.topsis import topsis
        topsis('inputfilename','Weights','Impacts','Outputfilename')
        ```
        make ensure the weights and impacts should be in "" 
        
        eg: "1,1,1,1" and "+,-,+,-"
        
        ## Pre-requisite
        The data should be enclosed in the csv file. There must be more than 2 columns
        
        
        ## Result
        the output(outputfilename)  is saved in the project folder with extra 2 columns with topsis score and rank.
