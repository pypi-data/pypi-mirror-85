when naming things, go from generic to specific:

# ok
def setup_something():
    pass

# don't use
def something_setup():
    pass


when initilizing something, use the "init" prefix since this corresponds with
python's __init__ method and should be intuative.  This is to be preferred over
the "prep" or "setup" prefix/postfix.

when possible, methods of a class should be defined in the order used.  Methods
called first should be higher in the class definition.
