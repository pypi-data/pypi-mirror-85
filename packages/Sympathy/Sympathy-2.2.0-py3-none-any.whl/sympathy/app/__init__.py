# Despicable check for anaconda, which has its own, unwelcome qt.conf.
# Relies on the fact that Pyside._utils.register_qt_conf will eventually
# look for qt.conf using os.path.exists in the directory of the python
# executable.
#
# Recent Anaconda does not provide PySide, so whatever Qt is included will
# likely be unusable.
