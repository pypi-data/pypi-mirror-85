## What is TOPSIS

**TOPSIS  (Technique for  Order Preference  by Similarity  to  Ideal Solution)**  is one  of the  numerical methods of the multi-criteria decision making. This is a broadly applicable method with a simple mathematical model.It chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance
from the ideal solution, and greatest distance from the negative-ideal
solution. 


## Steps used in TOPSIS

1)Normalize the given decision data
2)Find weighted normalized
3)Determine positive ideal and negative ideal solution
4)Calculate separation measures
5)Find relative closesness to ideal solution
6)Rank the preference order
