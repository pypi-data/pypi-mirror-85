Description: # PyGnuTLS
        
        This package provides a high level object oriented wrapper around libgnutls,
        as well as low level bindings to the GnuTLS types and functions via ctypes.
        The high level wrapper hides the details of accessing the GnuTLS library via
        ctypes behind a set of classes that encapsulate GnuTLS sessions, certificates
        and credentials and expose them to python applications using a simple API.
