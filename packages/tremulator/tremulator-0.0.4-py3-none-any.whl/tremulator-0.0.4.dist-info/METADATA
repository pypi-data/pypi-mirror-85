# Function emulation using Gaussian processes

`tremulator` provides the `Emulator` class for easy emulation
of expensive functions with user-defined training and acquisition
functions. It is built upon [`george`](https://github.com/dfm/george)
and allows the trained emulator to be saved to an
[`asdf`](https://github.com/spacetelescope/asdf) file. The saved file
can be read by the `Interpolator` class which then requires no more
training.
