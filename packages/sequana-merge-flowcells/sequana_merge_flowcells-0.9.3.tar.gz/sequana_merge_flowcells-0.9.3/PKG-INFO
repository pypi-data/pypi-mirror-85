Description: This is is the **merge_flowcells** pipeline from the `Sequana <https://sequana.readthedocs.org>`_ project
        
        :Overview: Merge gzipped FastQ files from several flowcells
        :Input: set of identically named FastQ files from several directories
        :Output: merged FastQ files stored in an output directory. 
        :Status: mature

        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You must install Sequana first::
        
            pip install sequana
        
        Then, just install this package::
        
            pip install sequana_merge_flowcells
        
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            sequana_pipelines_merge_flowcells --help
            sequana_pipelines_merge_flowcells --input-directory DATAPATH 
        
        This creates a directory with the pipeline and configuration file. You will then need 
        to execute the pipeline::
        
            cd merge_flowcells
            sh merge_flowcells.sh  # for a local run
        
        This launch a snakemake pipeline. If you are familiar with snakemake, you can 
        retrieve the pipeline itself and its configuration files and then execute the pipeline yourself with specific parameters::
        
            snakemake -s merge_flowcells.rules -c config.yaml --cores 4 --stats stats.txt
        
        Or use `sequanix <https://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/sequanix.html>`_ interface.
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This pipelines requires the following executable(s):
        
        - sequana
        - pigz
        - zcat

        Details
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        This pipeline runs **merge_flowcells** in parallel on the input fastq files (paired or not). 
        You have to provide at least two subdirectories. You may provide more. 
        The input FastQ files must be zipped in the current version. The input FastQ
        files found in the first directory muts be found in all subsequent directories.
        
        
        Rules and configuration details
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Here is the `latest documented configuration file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/sequana_merge_flowcells/master/sequana_pipelines/merge_flowcells/config.yaml>`_
        to be used with the pipeline. Each rule used in the pipeline may have a section in the configuration file.
