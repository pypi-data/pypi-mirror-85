About openEPDA
==============

openEPDAâ„¢ is a collection of open standards to be used in electronic-photonic
design automation. These include definition of data interchange formats to
facilitate Foundry PDK distribution and
easier simulation and measurement data exchange between the parties involved
in the PIC design chain.

openEPDA structure
------------------
openEPDA standards aim to cover the following parts of the EPDA:

1. Foundry PDK:

   a. Foundry technology including mask layers, cross-sections (*under development*);
   b. Foundry building blocks (:ref:`pdk_components`);
   c. Standard interconnects (:ref:`openepda_interconnects`);

2. Data (numeric / analytic, covers both raw measurement and analysis data):

   e. openEPDA data format (:ref:`openepda_data_format`);

3. Circuit design description (for measurements/ simulations):

   f. Chip description (:ref:`openepda_cdf_format`);
   g. Netlist format (*under development*);

4. Measurement / simulations definitions:

   h. Equipment API for python (*under development*);
   i. Measurement description (:ref:`openepda_mdf_format`);

5. General

   j. Analytic expression format to be used in other files (:ref:`analytic_expressions`)

In addition, there is a `openepda <https://pypi.org/project/openepda/>`_
python package, which includes validators for the above formats, as well as
file readers / writers.
