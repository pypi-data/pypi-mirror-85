.. _openepda_cdf_format_specification_v0_2:

Version 0.2
-----------
A file conforming to the openEPDA data format has the following structure.
The first line is a format identifier, ``# openEPDA CDF``. After
this, the data section follows, which adheres to the YAML format [1],
and contains all settings (numeric and textual) data in the form of an
associative array.

An example of a file recorded in the openEPDA CDF format is shown below.
