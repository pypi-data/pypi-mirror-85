If you're getting an error here that you think is being triggered incorrectly (e.g. because of an issue either with the
data on the website or the validation library — and not because of an issue with your scraper), you may re-run
validation with this check skipped.

If you think this is this error is getting thrown incorrectly due to an issue with the validator library,
please post in #sg-crawlers-external.

If you decide to skip this check, please include in your README the checks that you skipped and your reasons for
doing so.

To re-run with the above check skipped, run the same command as before with the following flag appended:
--ignore {}
