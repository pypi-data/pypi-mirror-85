# Calculate priority of the activities
--------------------------------------
This project was born after readning the comments in [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15686211) of HackerNews.
This application writes a file with a list of the activites and their priority (numeric index: 1 highest priority, 2 less prioritary, etc).
In detail:
* The application reads two existing files:
1. activity-date.csv (Activity,Start,End) about the duration of an activity
2. activity-importance.csv (Activity,Importance) about the importance of an activity. The meaning of importance is relative and vague. A definition can be: if you have two activites A and B in the same time, A is more important of B if doing A you can earn more money (or, lose less money) than doing B.
* The application writes one file ordered-activities.csv (Activity, Priority)


## Feature

[O] The input files can have a different order of the activities each other (now the order has to be the same, otherwise an Exception will be run)
[O] The final list can be separated in "activities already started" (start date minor than today) and "future activities" (start date major than today)
[O] The final list can be separated by the area of interest of the project (Area of responsability in GTD meaning)

## Bug

[X] Fix the unit test
[O] Resolve the TODO in the code
[O]  Organize the structure following the guidelines in [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python!](https://docs.python-guide.org/)

## Status CI Integration

I use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alepuzio/calculate-priority-activities.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alepuzio/calculate-priority-activities)

## Getting started

- pip
- pytest 

### Installing

- Clone the project with *git-clone* (or download directly it)
- Have fun!

## Running the tests

- In this version the unit test are inside the module and are not completed. TDD, sorry :(

### Break down into to end to end tests

No indications
