        * data_freq is a list of tuples (tuple_value,count) for each CSV row 
          with tuple_value containing read fields and count the positive integer
          giving the probability weight of this row;
        the arguments follow the same semantics as those of Python's csv.reader
        method, which supports different CSV formats
        see doc in http://docs.python.org/3.7/library/csv.html
        * if col_names is None, then the fields found in the first read row of the CSV
          file provide information on the attributes: each field is made up of a name,
          which shall be a valid identifier, followed by an optional 3-characters type
          code among  
            {b} -> boolean

            {f} -> float
            {s} -> string
            {#} -> count

          this field; for example, using the comma delimiter (default), the first row
          in the CSV file could be:
              name,age{i},heigth{f},married{b}
        * if col_names is not None, then col_names shall be a sequence of strings giving
          attribute information as described above, e.g.
              ('name','age{i}','heigth{f}','married{b}')
          it assumed that there is NO header row in the CSV file
        the type code defines the conversion to be applied to the fields read on the
        data lines; if the read value is empty, then it is converted to Python's None,
        except if the type is string, then, the value is the empty string; 
        if the read value is not empty and cannot be parsed for the expected type, then
        an exception is raised; for boolean type, the following values (case
        insensitive):
          '1', 't', 'true', 'y', 'yes' are interpreted as Python's True,
          '0', 'f', 'false', 'n', 'no' are interpreted as Python's False;
        the {#} code identifies a field that provides a count number of the row,
        representing the probability of the row or its frequency as a positive integer;
        such field is NOT included as attribute of the joint distribution; it is useful
        to define non-uniform probability distribution, as alternative to repeating the
        same row multiple times
