    Flea2a is a Flea2 subclass, which instance is defined by a given function applied on two given Lea arguments
    with a given "left-absorber" value (i.e. f(absorber,x) = absorber). This gives equivalent results as
    Flea2 (without absorber) but these could be more efficient by pruning the tree search. 
    The function is applied on all elements of the joint of the arguments. This results in a new
    probability distribution for all the values returned by the function.
    A Flea2a instance is a "functional pex", as defined in the paper on Statues algorithm
    (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09997).
