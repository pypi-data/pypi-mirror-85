    Clea is a Lea subclass, which instance is defined by a given sequence (L1,...Ln)
    of Lea instances; it represents a probability distribution made up from the
    joint L1 x ... x Ln; it associates each (v1,...,vn) tuple with probability
    P((v1,...,vn)) of having jointly (v1,...,vn). If the n events are independent,
    then P((v1,...,vn)) = product P1(v1) x ... x Pn(vn).
    A Clea instance is a "table pex", as defined in the paper on Statues algorithm
    (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09997).
