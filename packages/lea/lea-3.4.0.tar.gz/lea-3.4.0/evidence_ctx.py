    EvidenceCtx is a class which instance represents global conditions
    that can be activated or deactivated. At any given time, all active
    EvidenceCtx instances define implicir conditions that are enforced
    on all calculated probabilities; these become then automatically
    conditional probabilities (see Ilea class).
    An EvidenceCtx is defined by a sequence of condtions (boolean Lea
    instances) and bindings dictionary for binding Alea instances to
    given values ("observations"). Both data are optional. Semantically,
    these are combined together with a cunjunction (AND); the bindings
    {x:v) are equivalent to conditions (x==v) but these can be treated
    faster, especially if x's domain is large.
    An EvidenceCtx can be used as a Python context manager, using
    the 'with' keyword, making the activation/deactivation automatic.
