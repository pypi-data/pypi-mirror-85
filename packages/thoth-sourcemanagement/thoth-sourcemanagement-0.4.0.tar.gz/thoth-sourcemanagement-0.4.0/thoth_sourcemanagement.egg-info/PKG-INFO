Description: Thoth's Source Management
        =========================
        
        This library provides abstraction that allow's
        `thoth <https://thoth-station.ninja/>`__ to interact with various source
        management systems. We use OGR underneath to interact with git forges.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Use pipenv - This project is released on
        `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/thoth-sourcemanagement>`__, so the
        latest release can be installed via pip or
        `Pipenv <https://pipenv.readthedocs.io>`__ as shown below:
        
        ``pipenv install thoth-sourcemanagement``
        
        How to use -
        ------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from thoth.sourcemanagement.sourcemanagement import SourceManagement
            from thoth.sourcemanagement.enums import ServiceType
        
            # Service type you want to use
            service_type = ServiceType.GITHUB
            sm = SourceManagement(service_type, 'https://www.github.com', `private_token', 'username/repo_name')
        
        Or if you want to use the application to interact as a Github Application -
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # Service type you want to use
            service_type = ServiceType.GITHUB
            sm = SourceManagement(service_type=service_type, service_url='https://www.github.com', token=None, slug="username/repo_name", installation=True)
        
        The environment variables that need to be set are -
            * `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` - The path where the private key is located.
            * `GITHUB_APP_ID` - The Application ID of the Github app.
        
        
        You could then call all the functions offered by the Source Management class.
