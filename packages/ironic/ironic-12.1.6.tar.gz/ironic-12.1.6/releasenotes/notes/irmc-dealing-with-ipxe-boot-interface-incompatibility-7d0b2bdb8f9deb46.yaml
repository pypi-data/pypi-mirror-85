    iRMC hardware type deals with iPXE boot interface incompatibility.
    To iPXE boot with ``ipxe`` boot interface, *(1)* add ``ipxe`` to
    ``enabled_boot_interfaces`` in ``ironic.conf``, *(2)* set up tftp &
    http server following `Ironic document on iPXE boot configuration
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/install/configure-pxe.html>`,
    then *(3)* create/set baremetal node with ``--boot-interface ipxe``.

    iRMC hardware type deals with iPXE boot interface incompatibility.
    From Stein, ``[pxe]ipxe_enabled`` option has been deprecated and will be
    removed in preference to ``ipxe`` boot interface in Train cycle. Till then,
    iRMC hardware type supports iPXE boot through ``[pxe]ipxe_enabled`` option.
    To cope with this incompatibility, iRMC hardware type supports ``ipxe``
    boot interface.
