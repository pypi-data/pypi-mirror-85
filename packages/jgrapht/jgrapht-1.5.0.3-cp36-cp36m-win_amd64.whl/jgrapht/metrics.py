def diameter(graph):

    diameter of a graph is defined as :math:`\max_{v\in V}\epsilon(v)`, where :math:`\epsilon(v)`
    is the eccentricity of vertex :math:`v`. In other words, this method computes the 'longest
    shortest path'. Two special cases exist: (a) if the graph has no vertices, the diameter is 0,
    and (b) if the graph is disconnected, the diameter is positive infinity.

def girth(graph):

    The girth is the length of the shortest graph cycle (if any) in a graph. Acyclic graphs
    are considered to have infinite girth. For directed graphs, the length of the shortest 
    directed cycle is returned.

    This method invokes a breadth-first search from every vertex in the graph. Thus, its 
    runtime complexity is :math:`\mathcal{O}(n(m+n)) = \mathcal{O}(m n)`.
