def dinic(graph, source, sink):

    This is a :math:`\mathcal{O}(n^2 m)` algorithm where :math:`n` is the number of vertices 
    and :math:`m` the number of edges of the graph.

    The algorithm uses the graph edge weights as the network edge capacities.
    It returns a maximum s-t flow and a minimum s-t cut with the same value.
    
    :param graph: The input graph. This can be either directed or undirected. Edge capacities
                  are taken from the edge weights.

    Equivalent flow trees can be used to calculate the maximum flow value between all pairs 
    of vertices in an undirected network. It does so by performing :math:`n-1` minimum 
    s-t cut computations.

        on Computing, 19(1), p142-155, 1990

    This implementation uses the push-relabel algorithm for the minimum s-t cut which
    is :math:`\mathcal{O}(n^3)`. The total complexity is, therefore, :math:`\mathcal{O}(n^4)`.
