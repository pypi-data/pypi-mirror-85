def greedy_dsatur(graph):

    This is the greedy coloring algorithm using saturation degree ordering. The saturation degree of
    a vertex is defined as the number of different colors to which it is adjacent. The algorithm
    selects always the vertex with the largest saturation degree. If multiple vertices have the same
    maximum saturation degree, a vertex of maximum degree in the uncolored subgraph is selected.
 
    Note that the DSatur is not optimal in general, but is optimal for bipartite graphs. Compared to
    other simpler greedy ordering heuristics, it is usually considered slower but more efficient
    w.r.t. the number of used colors. See the following papers for details:
