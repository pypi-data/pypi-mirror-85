    In the :math:`G(n, M)` model, a graph is chosen uniformly at random from the collection
    of all graphs which have :math:`n` nodes and :math:`M` edges. For example, in the 
    :math:`G(3, 2)` model, each of the three possible graphs on three vertices and two edges
    are included with probability :math:`\frac{1}{3}`.
 
    The implementation creates the vertices and then randomly chooses an edge and tries to
    add it. If the add fails for any reason (an edge already exists and multiple edges are
    not allowed) it will just choose another and try again. The performance therefore varies
    significantly based on the probability of successfully constructing an acceptable edge.
 
    The implementation tries to guess the number of allowed edges based on the following. If
    self-loops or multiple edges are allowed and requested, the maximum number of edges is
    the maximum integer value. Otherwise the maximum for undirected graphs with :math:`n`
    vertices is :math:`\frac{n(n-1)}{2}` while for directed :math:`n(n-1)`.

       Nature 393(6684):440--442, 1998.

    .. note::
    
        The following paragraph from the paper describes the construction.

        "The generator starts with a ring of :math:`n` vertices, each connected to its :math:`k`
        nearest neighbors (:math:`k` must be even). Then it chooses a vertex and the edge that
        connects it to its nearest neighbor in a clockwise sense. With probability :math:`p`, it
        reconnects this edge to a vertex chosen uniformly at random over the entire ring with
        duplicate edges forbidden; otherwise it leaves the edge in place. The process is repeated
        by moving clock-wise around the ring, considering each vertex in turn until one lap is
        completed. Next, it considers the edges that connect vertices to their second-nearest
        neighbors clockwise. As before, it randomly rewires each of these edges with probability
        :math:`p`, and continues this process, circulating around the ring and proceeding outward
        to more distant neighbors after each lap, until each edge in the original lattice has been
        considered once. As there are :math:`\frac{nk}{2}` edges in the entire graph, the rewiring
        process stops after :math:`\frac{k}{2}`. For :math:`p=0`, the original ring is unchanged;
        as :math:`p` increases, the graph becomes increasingly disordered until for :math:`p=1`,
        all edges are rewired randomly. For intermediate values of :math:`p`, the graph is a
        small-world network: highly clustered like a regular graph, yet with small characteristic
        path length, like a random graph."

    The authors require :math:`n \gg k \gg \ln(n) \gg 1` and specifically
    :math:`k \gg \ln(n)` guarantees that a random graph will be connected.
