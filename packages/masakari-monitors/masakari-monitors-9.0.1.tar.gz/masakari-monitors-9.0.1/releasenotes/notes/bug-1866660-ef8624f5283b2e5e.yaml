features:
  - |
    A 'hostname' option has been added to the Masakari monitors configuration
    file which replaces the 'host' option. The option should be used to specify
    the Hostname, FQDN or IP address of the host.
deprecations:
  - |
    The 'host' option in the 'DEFAULT' section has been deprecated as it
    clashes with the name of a section in the same file. It has been replaced
    by the 'hostname' option.
