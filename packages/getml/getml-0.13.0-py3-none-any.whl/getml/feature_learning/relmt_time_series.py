class RelMTTimeSeries(_FeatureLearner):
    """Feature learning based on relational linear model trees.

    :class:`~getml.feature_learning.RelMTTimeSeries` automates feature learning
    for relational data and time series. It is based on a
    generalization of linear model trees to relational data, hence
    the name. A linear model tree is a decision tree
    with linear models on its leaves.

    Args:
        horizon (float, optional):

            The period of time you want to look ahead to generate the
            predictions.

        memory (float, optional):

            The period of time you want to the to look back until the
            algorithm "forgets" the data. If you set memory to 0.0, then
            there will be no limit.

        self_join_keys (List[str], optional):

            A list of the join keys to use for the self-join. If none are
            passed, then the self join will take place on the entire population
            table.

        ts_name (str, optional):

            The name of the time stamp column to be used. If none is passed,
            then the row ID will be used.

        allow_lagged_targets (bool, optional):

            In some time series problems, it is allowed to aggregate over
            target variables from the past. In others, this is not allowed.
            If *allow_lagged_targets* is set to True, you must pass a horizon
            that is greater than zero, otherwise you would have a data leak
            (an exception will be thrown to prevent this).

        allow_avg (bool, optional):

            Whether to allow an AVG aggregation. Particularly for time
            series problems, AVG aggregations are not necessary and you
            can save some time by taking them out.

        delta_t (float, optional):

            Frequency with which lag variables will be explored in a
            time series setting. When set to 0.0, there will be no lag
            variables.

            For more information, please refer to
            :ref:`data_model_time_series`. Range: [0, :math:`\\infty`]

        gamma (float, optional):

            During the training of RelMT, which is based on
            gradient tree boosting, this value serves as the minimum
            improvement in terms of the `loss_function` required for a
            split of the tree to be applied. Larger `gamma` will lead
            to fewer partitions of the tree and a more conservative
            algorithm. Range: [0, :math:`\\infty`]

        include_categorical (bool, optional):

            Whether you want to pass categorical columns from the
            population table to the `feature_selector` and
            `predictor`. Passing columns directly allows you to include
            handcrafted feature as well as raw data. Note, however,
            that this does not guarantee their presence in the
            resulting features because it is the task of the
            `feature_selector` to pick only the best performing
            ones.

        loss_function (:class:`~getml.models.loss_functions`, optional):

            Objective function used by the feature learning algorithm
            to optimize your features. For regression problems use
            :class:`~getml.models.loss_functions.SquareLoss` and for
            classification problems use
            :class:`~getml.models.loss_functions.CrossEntropyLoss`.

        max_depth (int, optional):

            Maximum depth of the trees generated during the gradient
            tree boosting. Deeper trees will result in more complex
            models and increase the risk of overfitting. Range: [0,
            :math:`\\infty`]

        min_num_samples (int, optional):

            Determines the minimum number of samples a subcondition
            should apply to in order for it to be considered. Higher
            values lead to less complex statements and less danger of
            overfitting. Range: [1, :math:`\\infty`]

        num_features (int, optional):

            Number of features generated by the feature learning
            algorithm. Range: [1, :math:`\\infty`]

        num_subfeatures (int, optional):

            The number of subfeatures you would like to extract in a
            subensemble (for snowflake data model only). See
            :ref:`data_model_snowflake_schema` for more
            information. Range: [1, :math:`\\infty`]

        num_threads (int, optional):

            Number of threads used by the feature learning algorithm. If set to
            zero or a negative value, the number of threads will be
            determined automatically by the getML engine. Range:
            [-:math:`\\infty`, :math:`\\infty`]

        reg_lambda (float, optional):

            L2 regularization on the weights in the gradient boosting
            routine. This is one of the most important hyperparameters
            in the :class:`~getml.feature_learning.RelMTTimeSeries` as it allows
            for the most direct regularization. Larger values will
            make the resulting model more conservative. Range: [0,
            :math:`\\infty`]

        sampling_factor (float, optional):

            RelMT uses a bootstrapping procedure (sampling with
            replacement) to train each of the features. The sampling
            factor is proportional to the share of the samples
            randomly drawn from the population table every time
            RelMT generates a new feature. A lower sampling factor
            (but still greater than 0.0), will lead to less danger of
            overfitting, less complex statements and faster
            training. When set to 1.0, roughly 20,000 samples are drawn
            from the population table. If the population table
            contains less than 20,000 samples, it will use standard
            bagging. When set to 0.0, there will be no sampling at
            all. Range: [0, :math:`\\infty`]

        seed (Union[int,None], optional):

            Seed used for the random number generator that underlies
            the sampling procedure to make the calculation
            reproducible. Internally, a `seed` of None will be mapped to
            5543. Range: [0, :math:`\\infty`]

        shrinkage (float, optional):

            Since RelMT works using a gradient-boosting-like
            algorithm, `shrinkage` (or learning rate) scales down the
            weights and thus the impact of each new tree. This gives
            more room for future ones to improve the overall
            performance of the model in this greedy algorithm. It must
            be between 0.0 and 1.0 with higher values leading to more
            danger of overfitting. Range: [0, 1]

        silent (bool, optional):

            Controls the logging during training.

        use_timestamps (bool, optional):

            Whether you want to ignore all elements in the peripheral
            tables where the time stamp is greater than the one in the
            corresponding elements of the population table. In other
            words, this determines whether you want add the condition

            .. code-block:: sql

                t2.time_stamp <= t1.time_stamp

            at the very end of each feature. It is strongly recommend
            to enable this behavior.

        Raises:
            TypeError:
                If any of the input arguments is of wrong type.
            KeyError:
                If an unsupported instance variable is encountered.
            TypeError:
                If any instance variable is of wrong type.
            ValueError:
                If any instance variable does not match its possible
                choices (string) or is out of the expected bounds
                (numerical).

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # Our forecast horizon is 0.
            # We do not predict the future, instead we infer
            # the present state from current and past sensor data.
            horizon = 0.0

            # We do not allow the time series features
            # to use target values from the past.
            # (Otherwise, we would need the horizon to
            # be greater than 0.0).
