    Seasonal extracts seasonal data from time stamps.

    The preprocessor automatically iterates through
    all time stamps in any data frame and extracts
    seasonal parameters.

    These include:
        - year
        - month
        - weekday
        - hour
        - minute

    The algorithm also evaluates the potential
    usefulness of any extracted seasonal parameter.
    Parameters that are unlikely to be useful are
    not included.
