"""Convenience functions for the handling of time stamps.

In getML, time stamps are always expressed as a floating point value. This float
measures the number of seconds since UNIX time (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00).
Smaller units of time are expressed as fractions of a second.

To make this a bit easier to handle, this module contains simple convenience
functions that express other time units in terms of seconds."""
