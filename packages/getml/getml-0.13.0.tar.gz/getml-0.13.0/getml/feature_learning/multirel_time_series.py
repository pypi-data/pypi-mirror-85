class MultirelTimeSeries(_FeatureLearner):
    """Feature learning for time series based on multi-relational decision tree learning.

    :class:`~getml.models.MultirelTimeSeries` automates feature learning
    for time series. It adds a convenience layer over
    :class:`~getml.feature_learning.MultirelModel` which abstracts away
    the self-join over the population table.

    For more information on the underlying feature learning algorithm, check
    out the :ref:`User guide <feature_engineering_algorithms_multirel>`.

    Args:
        horizon (float, optional):

            The period of time you want to look ahead to generate the
            predictions.

        memory (float, optional):

            The period of time you want to the to look back until the
            algorithm "forgets" the data. If you set memory to 0.0, then
            there will be no limit.

        self_join_keys (List[str], optional):

            A list of the join keys to use for the self join. If none are
            passed, then the self join will take place on the entire population
            table.

        ts_name (str, optional):

            The name of the time stamp column to be used. If none is passed,
            then the row ID will be used.

        allow_lagged_targets (bool, optional):

            In some time series problems, it is allowed to aggregate over
            target variables from the past. In others, this is not allowed.
            If *allow_lagged_targets* is set to True, you must pass a horizon
            that is greater than zero, otherwise you would have a data leak
            (an exception will be thrown to prevent this).

        aggregation (List[:class:`~getml.models.aggregations`], optional):

            Mathematical operations used by the automated feature
            learning algorithm to create new features.

            Possible options:

                * :const:`~getml.models.aggregations.Avg`
                * :const:`~getml.models.aggregations.Count`
                * :const:`~getml.models.aggregations.CountDistinct`
                * :const:`~getml.models.aggregations.CountMinusCountDistinct`
                * :const:`~getml.models.aggregations.Max`
                * :const:`~getml.models.aggregations.Median`
                * :const:`~getml.models.aggregations.Min`
                * :const:`~getml.models.aggregations.Stddev`
                * :const:`~getml.models.aggregations.Sum`
                * :const:`~getml.models.aggregations.Var`

        allow_sets (bool, optional):

            Multirel can summarize different categories into sets for
            producing conditions. When expressed as SQL statements these
            sets might look like this:

            .. code-block:: sql

                t2.category IN ( 'value_1', 'value_2', ... )

            This can be very powerful, but it can also produce
            features that are hard to read and might be prone to
            overfitting when the `sampling_factor` is too low.

        delta_t (float, optional):

            Frequency with which lag variables will be explored in a
            time series setting. When set to 0.0, there will be no lag
            variables.

            For more information please refer to
            :ref:`data_model_time_series`. Range: [0, :math:`\\infty`]

        grid_factor (float, optional):

            Multirel will try a grid of critical values for your
            numerical features. A higher `grid_factor` will lead to a
            larger number of critical values being considered. This
            can increase the training time, but also lead to more
            accurate features. Range: (0, :math:`\\infty`]

        include_categorical (bool, optional):

            Whether you want to pass categorical columns from the
            population table to the `feature_selector` and
            `predictor`. Passing columns directly allows you to include
            handcrafted feature as well as raw data. Note, however,
            that this does not guarantee their presence in the
            resulting features because it is the task of the
            `feature_selector` to pick only the best performing
            ones.

        loss_function (:class:`~getml.models.loss_functions`, optional):

            Objective function used by the feature learning algorithm
            to optimize your features. For regression problems use
            :class:`~getml.models.loss_functions.SquareLoss` and for
            classification problems use
            :class:`~getml.models.loss_functions.CrossEntropyLoss`.

        max_length (int, optional):

            The maximum length a subcondition might have. Multirel
            will create conditions in the form

            .. code-block:: sql

                (condition 1.1 AND condition 1.2 AND condition 1.3 )
                OR ( condition 2.1 AND condition 2.2 AND condition 2.3 )
                ...

            Using this parameter you can set the maximum number of
            conditions allowed in the brackets. Range: [0,
            :math:`\\infty`]

        min_num_samples (int, optional):

            Determines the minimum number of samples a subcondition
            should apply to in order for it to be considered. Higher
            values lead to less complex statements and less danger of
            overfitting. Range: [1, :math:`\\infty`]

        num_features (int, optional):

            Number of features generated by the feature learning
            algorithm. Range: [1, :math:`\\infty`]

        num_subfeatures (int, optional):

            The number of subfeatures you would like to extract in a
            subensemble (for snowflake data model only). See
            :ref:`data_model_snowflake_schema` for more
            information. Range: [1, :math:`\\infty`]

        num_threads (int, optional):

            Number of threads used by the feature learning algorithm. If set to
            zero or a negative value, the number of threads will be
            determined automatically by the getML engine. Range:
            [:math:`0`, :math:`\\infty`]

        regularization (float, optional):

            Most important regularization parameter for the quality of
            the features produced by Multirel. Higher values will lead
            to less complex features and less danger of overfitting. A
            `regularization` of 1.0 is very strong and allows no
            conditions. Range: [0, 1]

        round_robin (bool, optional):

            If True, the Multirel picks a different `aggregation`
            every time a new feature is generated.

        sampling_factor (float, optional):

            Multirel uses a bootstrapping procedure (sampling with
            replacement) to train each of the features. The sampling
            factor is proportional to the share of the samples
            randomly drawn from the population table every time
            Multirel generates a new feature. A lower sampling factor
            (but still greater than 0.0), will lead to less danger of
            overfitting, less complex statements and faster
            training. When set to 1.0, roughly 2,000 samples are drawn
            from the population table. If the population table
            contains less than 2,000 samples, it will use standard
            bagging. When set to 0.0, there will be no sampling at
            all. Range: [0, :math:`\\infty`]

        seed (Union[int,None], optional):

            Seed used for the random number generator that underlies
            the sampling procedure to make the calculation
            reproducible. Internally, a `seed` of None will be mapped to
            5543. Range: [0, :math:`\\infty`]

        share_aggregations (float, optional):

            Every time a new feature is generated, the `aggregation`
            will be taken from a random subsample of possible
            aggregations and values to be aggregated. This parameter
            determines the size of that subsample. Only relevant when
            `round_robin` is False. Range: (0, 1]

        share_conditions (float, optional):

            Every time a new column is tested for applying conditions,
            it might be skipped at random. This parameter determines
            the probability that a column will *not* be
            skipped. Range: [0, 1]

        shrinkage (float, optional):

            Since Multirel works using a gradient-boosting-like
            algorithm, `shrinkage` (or learning rate) scales down the
            weights and thus the impact of each new tree. This gives
            more room for future ones to improve the overall
            performance of the model in this greedy algorithm. Higher
            values will lead to more danger of overfitting. Range: [0,
            1]

        silent (bool, optional):

            Controls the logging during training.

        use_timestamps (bool, optional):

            Whether you want to ignore all elements in the peripheral
            tables where the time stamp is greater than the one in the
            corresponding elements of the population table. In other
            words, this determines whether you want add the condition

            .. code-block:: sql

                t2.time_stamp <= t1.time_stamp

            at the very end of each feature. It is strongly recommend
            to enable this behavior.

    Raises:
        TypeError:
            If any of the input arguments is of wrong type.
        KeyError:
            If an unsupported instance variable is encountered.
        TypeError:
            If any instance variable is of wrong type.
        ValueError:
            If any instance variable does not match its possible
            choices (string) or is out of the expected bounds
            (numerical).

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # Our forecast horizon is 0.
            # We do not predict the future, instead we infer
            # the present state from current and past sensor data.
            horizon = 0.0

            # We do not allow the time series features
            # to use target values from the past.
            # (Otherwise, we would need the horizon to
            # be greater than 0.0).
            allow_lagged_targets = False

            # We want our time series features to only use
            # data from the last 15 minutes
            memory = getml.data.time.minutes(15)
