description: 'Example of converting real and imagniary into magnitude and phase from
  GUM Supplement 2, section 9.3.


  The GUM supplement considers six cases, re = 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, with and without
  correlation coefficient of 0.9 between re and im.


  Try calculating with various values of re and adding correlation. Switch the output
  view to "Joint PDF" to view probability plots similar to those in the GUM.'
