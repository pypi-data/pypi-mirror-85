## Setup

To use Amazon S3 storage with the gateway, you must set up some Amazon S3 storage and set some AWS configuration settings on the computer where Brizo is running. For details, see:

## Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Github actions.
Our tests use the pytest framework.

## New Version

The `bumpversion.sh` script helps to bump the project version. You can execute the script using as first argument {major|minor|patch} to bump accordingly the version.

Note: Installing this package (metadata-driver-aws) installs the boto3 package which also has an Apache-2.0 license. Installing boto3 installs the docutils package. The docutils package might have licensing that is incompatible with the Apache-2.0 license. We have opened [an issue](https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/1916) on the boto3 repository to let them know about the potential licensing conflict and to resolve it if necessary.
