"""
Benchmarking Suite for NumExpr3
===============================

The suite for NE3 is designed for internal comparisons of different versions of 
NE3. Previous efforts to also compare to NumExpr2.6/Numba became a little overly 
complicated and have been abandoned as a result.

What we want here is some standard that specifies the information a benchmark
should collect for inclusion in a JSON file.

Filename convention
-------------------

<machine_name>_<ne_version>

Software info
-------------

NumPy version
NumExpr version
Compiler name
Compiler version
Compiler flags
Block size (when compiled with fixed BLOCKSIZE)

Hardware info
-------------
CPU Clock speed
Virtual cores
Physical cores
Number of processors
Cache sizes
CPU flags

Timings
-------
Stored as a dict that can be saved as JSON, which requires ``str`` keys.
