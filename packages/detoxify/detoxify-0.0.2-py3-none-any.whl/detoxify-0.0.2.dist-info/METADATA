## Description   

Trained models & code to predict toxic comments on 3 Jigsaw challenges: Toxic comment classification, UnintendedÂ Bias in Toxic comments, Multilingual toxic comment classification.

Built by [Laura Hanu](https://laurahanu.github.io/) at [Unitary](https://www.unitary.ai/), where we are working to stop harmful content online by interpreting visual content in context. 

Dependencies:
- For inference:
  - ðŸ¤— Transformers
  - âš¡ Pytorch lightning 
- For training will also need:
  - Kaggle API (to download data)

### Disclaimer:

If words that are associated with swearing, insults or profanity are present in a comment, it is likely that it will be classified as toxic, regardless of the tone or the intent of the author e.g. humorous/self-deprecating.

| Challenge | Year | Goal | Original Data Source | Top Leaderboard Score | Detoxify Score
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) | 2018 |  build a multi-headed model thatâ€™s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. | Wikipedia Comments | 0.98856 | 0.98636
| [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification) | 2019 | build a model that recognizes toxicity and minimizes this type of unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities. You'll be using a dataset labeled for identity mentions and optimizing a metric designed to measure unintended bias. | Civil Comments | 0.94734 | 0.93639
| [Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification) | 2020 | build effective multilingual models | Wikipedia Comments + Civil Comments | 0.9536 | 0.91655*

*Score not directly comparable since it is obtained on the validation set provided and not on the test set. To update when the test labels are made available. 

It is also noteworthy to mention that the top leadearboard scores have been achieved using model ensembles. The purpose of this library was to build something user-friendly and straightforward to use.

## Quick prediction
```bash
# clone project   

pip install detoxify

```
```python

from detoxify import Detoxify

# model name can be: original, unbiased or multilingual

results = Detoxify('unbiased').predict('example text')

# optional to display results nicely (will need to pip install pandas)

import pandas as pd
print(pd.DataFrame(results).round(4))

```
For more details check the Prediction section.

## Labels
All challenges have a toxicity label. The toxicity labels represent the aggregate ratings of up to 10 annotators according the following schema:
- **Very Toxic** (a very hateful, aggressive, or disrespectful comment that is very likely to make you leave a discussion or give up on sharing your perspective)
- **Toxic** (a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is somewhat likely to make you leave a discussion or give up on sharing your perspective)
- **Hard to Say**
- **Not Toxic**

More information about the labelling schema can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data).

### Toxic Comment Classification Challenge
This challenge includes the following labels:

- `toxic`
- `severe_toxic`
- `obscene`
- `threat`
- `insult`
- `identity_hate`

### Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification
This challenge has 2 types of labels: the main toxicity labels and some additional identity labels that represent the identities mentioned in the comments. 

Only identities with more than 500 examples in the test set (combined public and private) are included during training as additional labels and in the evaluation calculation.

- `toxicity`
- `severe_toxicity`
- `obscene`
- `threat`
- `insult`
- `identity_attack`
- `sexual_explicit`

Identity labels used:
- `male`
- `female`
- `homosexual_gay_or_lesbian`
- `christian`
- `jewish`
- `muslim`
- `black`
- `white`
- `psychiatric_or_mental_illness`

A complete list of all the identity labels available can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data).


### Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification

Since this challenge combines the data from the previous 2 challenges, it includes all labels from above, however the final evaluation is only on:

- `toxicity`

## How to run   

First, install dependencies   
```bash
# clone project   

git clone https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify

# create virtual env

python3 -m venv toxic-env
source toxic-env/bin/activate

# install project   

pip install -e detoxify
cd detoxify

# for training
pip install -r requirements.txt

 ```   

## Prediction

Trained models summary:

|Model name| Transformer type| Data from
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|`original`| `bert-base-uncased` | Toxic Comment Classification Challenge
|`unbiased`| `roberta-base`| Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification
|`multilingual`| `xlm-roberta-base`| Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification

For a quick prediction can run the example script on a comment directly or from a csv containing a list of comments. 
```bash

# from model name via torch.hub

python run_prediction.py --input 'shut up, you are a liar' --model_name original

# from checkpoint path

python run_prediction.py --input test_set.csv --from_ckpt_path model_path

# to see usage

python run_prediction.py --help

```

Checkpoints can be downloaded from the latest release or via the Pytorch hub API with the following names:
- `toxic_bert`
- `unbiased_toxic_roberta`
- `multilingual_toxic_xlm_r`
```bash
model = torch.hub.load('unitaryai/detoxify','toxic_bert')
```

Importing detoxify in python:

```python

from detoxify import Detoxify

results = Detoxify('unbiased').predict('some text')

# to display results nicely

import pandas as pd
print(pd.DataFrame(results).round(4))

```


## Training

 If you do not already have a Kaggle account:

```
## Start Training
 ### Toxic Comment Classification Challenge

 ```bash

python create_val_set.py

python train.py --config configs/Toxic_comment_classification_BERT.json
``` 
 ### Unintended Bias in Toxicicity Challenge

```bash

python train.py --config configs/Unintended_bias_toxic_comment_classification_RoBERTa.json

```
 ### Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification

 This is trained in 2 stages. First, train on all available data, and second, train only on the translated versions of the first challenge. 

 The [translated data](https://www.kaggle.com/miklgr500/jigsaw-train-multilingual-coments-google-api) can be downloaded from Kaggle in french, spanish, italian, portuguese, turkish, and russian (the languages available in the test set).

 ```bash

# stage 1

python train.py --config configs/Multilingual_toxic_comment_classification_XLMR.json

# stage 2

python train.py --config configs/Multilingual_toxic_comment_classification_XLMR_stage2.json

```
### Monitor progress with tensorboard

 ```bash

tensorboard --logdir=./saved

```
## Model Evaluation

### Toxic Comment Classification Challenge

This challenge is evaluated on the mean AUC score of all the labels.

```bash

python evaluate.py --checkpoint saved/lightning_logs/checkpoints/example_checkpoint.pth --test_csv test.csv

```
### Unintended Bias in Toxicicity Challenge

This challenge is evaluated on a novel bias metric that combines different AUC scores to balance overall performance. More information on this metric [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview/evaluation).

```bash

python evaluate.py --checkpoint saved/lightning_logs/checkpoints/example_checkpoint.pth --test_csv test.csv

# to get the final bias metric
python model_eval/compute_bias_metric.py

```
### Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification

This challenge is evaluated on the AUC score of the main toxic label.

```bash

python evaluate.py --checkpoint saved/lightning_logs/checkpoints/example_checkpoint.pth --test_csv test.csv

```
