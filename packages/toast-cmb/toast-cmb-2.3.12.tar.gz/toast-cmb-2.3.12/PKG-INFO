        ## Description
        
        TOAST is a [software framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) for
        simulating and processing timestream data collected by telescopes. Telescopes which
        collect data as timestreams rather than images give us a unique set of analysis
        challenges. Detector data usually contains noise which is correlated in time as well as
        sources of correlated signal from the instrument and the environment. Large pieces of
        data must often be analyzed simultaneously to extract an estimate of the sky signal.
