Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 3.5.0 (18 Nov 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added some missing test cache entries.
        
          * Added missing line joiner settings for <artwork>, <artset> and 
            <sourcecode> within <blockquote>.  Fixes issue #569
        
          * Fixed a diff exclusion regex in the Makefile, and added a Makefile target
            to update manpage and docfiles, and a mkrelease step to update those files
            with the new release version as part of the release actions.
        
          * Changed the output text for <xref> with text content equal to the 
            reference tag to output both, rather than suppressing one.  Fixes issue 
            #571.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 3.4.0 (06 Nov 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added handling for 'indent' attributes that have been set to the empty
            string.  Fixes issue #564.
        
          * Added some new unlisted switches to make some test cases easier to 
            maintain.
        
          * Changed the default handling for draft reference XIncludes to use 
            revision-agnostic bibxml URLs in v2-to-v3 conversions, and added a switch 
            to use explicit revisions instead if desired.
        
          * Tweaked doc.py and doc.xml to suppress mention of switches with 
            argparse.SUPPRESS help settings, for consistency between --help and --doc 
            output.
        
          * Changed the text output for <xref format='title'/> on request from the 
            RPC.  Fixes issue #563.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 3.3.0 (19 Oct 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Removed validation before unprepping in order to be able to process source
            files that use XInclude without failing validation because of missing IDREF
            targets.
        
          * Fixed a problem where some name entries permitted Latin script names, 
            but not all.  Fixed a misleading error message for <iref> elements that
            lack a useful anchor to refer back to.
        
          * Fixed some diff exclusion patterns in the Makefile.
        
          * Added a couple of test cases.
