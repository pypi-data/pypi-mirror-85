# Using GitHub for CI/CD

This repository is meant to accompany the "Using GitHub for CI/CD" workshop from
the NetApp YWIT 2020 event: https://netapp.ywit.io/workshops/ci_cd_with_github

Contained here is a simple Python package and a set of simple GitHub actions which
allow for automation of the testing, building, and release of a Python package.

The techniques shown in the workshop are not unique to a Python package but can
be applied to any project you might create and store in GitHub.
