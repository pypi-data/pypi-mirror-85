## Develop

### Bump Version

Run `bump2version x.y.z` to bump to the next version. We will always tag any version we bump, and this creates the relevant commits/tags for you. All you need to do is `git push --tags` and that should be it.

# Examples

```
import itkdb

client = itkdb.Client()
comps = client.get(
    'listComponents', json={'project': 'P', 'pageInfo': {'pageSize': 32}}
)

for i, comp in enumerate(comps):
    print(i, comp['code'])
```
