Description: # FarsTail: A Persian Natural Language Inference Dataset
        <br>
        <br>
        Natural Language Inference (NLI), also called Textual Entailment, is an important task in NLP with the goal of determining the inference relationship between a premise p and a hypothesis h. It is a three-class problem, where each pair (p, h) is assigned to one of these classes: "ENTAILMENT" if the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, "CONTRADICTION" if the hypothesis contradicts the premise, and "NEUTRAL" if none of the above holds.
        <br>There are large datasets such as SNLI, MNLI, and SciTail for NLI in English, but there are few datasets for poor-data languages like Persian.
        <br>Persian (Farsi) language is a pluricentric language spoken by around 110 million people in countries like Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. Here, we present the first relatively large-scale Persian dataset for NLI task, called FarsTail. A total of 10,367 samples are generated from a collection of 3,539 multiple-choice questions. The train, validation, and test portions include 7,266, 1,537, and 1,564 instances, respectively.

        ## Getting started with package
        We have provided an API in the form of a python package to read and use FarsTail easier for persian and non-persian language researchers. In the following, we will explain how to use this package.
        <br>
        <br>You'll need Python 3.6 or higher.
        ### Installation
        ```
        pip install farstail
        ```
        ### using
        * Loading the original FarsTail dataset.
        ```python
        from farstail.datasets import farstail
        train_data, val_data, test_data = farstail.load_original_data()
        ```
        
        
        * Loading the indexed FarsTail dataset.
        ```python
        from farstail.datasets import farstail
        train_ind, val_ind, test_ind, dictionary = farstail.load_indexed_data()
        ```
