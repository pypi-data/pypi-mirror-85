        # open-journal
        A simple, private, open-source journal for Linux. No user data is collected.
        
        ### Encryption
        Journals can be optionally encrypted using a uniquely generated encryption key. The *cryptography* library used is built on AES. The encryption key only needs to be generated once. Export a copy of it from the program and store it in a safe place. 
        
        The encryption key must be stored in the same location as **main.py**. It is placed here automatically upon generation.
        
        ### Installation and Usage
        Install Open Journal via pip. Preferably in a new pip or conda environment for easy management. Use *pip3* if necessary.
        ~~~
        $ pip install open-journal

        To run, execute the following from a terminal, in same environment it was installed.
