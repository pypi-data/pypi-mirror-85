Description: Timeseries Analysis and Plotting (TAP) Tool
        ===========================================
        
        Abstract
        --------
        
        The Timeseries Analysis and Plotting (TAP) Tool is being developed to
        provide exploratory data analysis for the Land Change Monitoring,
        Assessment, and Projection
        (`LCMAP <https://eros.usgs.gov/science/land-change-monitoring-assessment-and-projection-lcmap>`__)
        project at `USGS EROS <https://eros.usgs.gov/>`__. TAP is an open-source
        project written in python that uses PyQt5 and matplotlib for generating
        interactive GUIs and plots. Currently, it provides the following
        functionality:
        
        - Plot a timeseries of Landsat Analysis Ready Data
          (`ARD <https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/us-landsat-analysis-ready-data>`__)
        
          - Landsat 4-7 Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 Surface Reflectance
          - Landsat 8 Bands 2-7 Surface Reflectance
          - Landsat 4-7 Band 6 Brightness Temperature
          - Landsat 8 Band 10 Brightness Temperature
        
        - Plot model parameters and curve-fits from the Continuous Change
          Detection and Classification
          (`CCDC <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425714000248>`__)
          algorithm
        - Calculate indices on the fly for plotting and visualization
        
          - NDVI
          - MSAVI
          - SAVI
          - EVI
          - NDMI
          - NBR
          - NBR-2
        
        - Display RGB visualizations of Landsat ARD
        - Export plotted Landsat ARD surface reflectance, brightness
          temperature, and index values to a .csv file
        - Save a plot figure as a .png file
        - Save a Landsat ARD RGB display as a .png file
        - Save ESRI point shapefile for plotted coordinates
        
        --------------
        
        **The tool currently requires the following data inputs:**
        
        - Landsat ARD (obtained via HTTP request).
        - Serialized change and cover results generated by
          `PyCCD <https://eroslab.cr.usgs.gov/lcmap/pyccd>`__ (obtained via HTTP request).
        
        Landsat ARD and the PyCCD algorithm are publicly available.
        
        However, TAP requires access to ARD and PyCCD results via web-services
        that are available to on-site personnel at USGS EROS only.
        
        For those reasons, TAP is not intended for general public use until the
        datasets become widely available at a future date.
        
        --------------
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        **Note on PyQt5**: It is recommended to use PyQt5==5.10.1
        because of an issue in later versions in which Qtwebengineprocess does
        not close on TAP exit.
        
        --------------
        
        Create a Virtual Environment
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - `Install Miniconda3 <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__
        
        - Create a Conda virtual environment
        
          - Linux
        
            .. code:: bash
        
               conda create --name tap python=3.6.7 gdal=2.2.2 poppler=0.60.1 cython cytoolz
        
          - Windows
        
            .. code:: powershell
        
               conda create --name tap python=3.6.7 gdal=2.2.2 cython cytoolz
        
          - If you experience SSL cert errors, disable ssl verification and try to create the env again.
        
            .. code:: bash
        
               conda config --set ssl_verify false
        
        - Activate the environment
        
          .. code:: bash
        
             conda activate tap
        
        
        Install TAP
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Ensure the virtual environment is activated from previous creation steps.
        
        - Use pip to install TAP's latest standard release and the remaining dependencies
        
          .. code:: bash
        
             pip install lcmap-tap
        
          - If you are having trusted host/certificate issues during pip install,
            you can explicitly trust pypi
        
            .. code:: bash
        
               pip install lcmap-tap --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
        
          - To install a pre-release or another specific version instead of a standard release:
        
            .. code:: bash
        
              pip install lcmap-tap==2.0.0rc2
        
        - Create the configuration file required by tap
        
          - Note: Location may differ depending on if it was installed for a single user vs system wide.
        
          - Linux Example
        
            - Create and edit as needed
        
              .. code:: bash
        
                 cd $HOME/.conda/envs/tap/lib/python3.6/site-packages/lcmap_tap/
                 cp config-example.yaml config.yaml
        
          - Windows Example
        
            - Create and edit as needed
        
              .. code:: powershell
        
                 cd $HOME\AppData\Local\Continuum\miniconda3\envs\tap\Lib\site-packages\lcmap_tap
                 cp config-example.yaml config.yaml
        
        Run the Tool
        ------------
        
        Once installed, lcmap_tap can be executed directly from the command line
        if the virtual environment is activated:
        
        - Note: Location may differ depending on if it was installed for a single user vs system wide.
        
        - Linux
        
          .. code:: bash
        
             lcmap_tap
        
        - Windows
        
          .. code:: powershell
        
             python.exe $HOME\AppData\Local\Continuum\miniconda3\envs\tap\Scripts\lcmap_tap.exe
        
        Upgrades
        --------
        
        To upgrade an already installed version of tap:
        
        - Activate the environment
        
          .. code:: bash
        
             conda activate tap
        
        - Upgrade to the latest standard release
        
          .. code:: bash
        
            pip install --upgrade lcmap-tap
        
          - Alternatively, upgrade to a specific release
        
            .. code:: bash
        
              pip install --upgrade lcmap-tap==2.0.0rc2
        
        - If configuration parameters have changed in a new release, copy the config example:
        
          - Note: Location may differ depending on if it was installed for a single user vs system wide.
        
          - Linux Example
        
            - Create and edit as needed
        
              .. code:: bash
        
                 cd $HOME/.conda/envs/tap/lib/python3.6/site-packages/lcmap_tap/
                 cp config-example.yaml config.yaml
        
          - Windows Example
        
            - Create and edit as needed
        
              .. code:: powershell
        
                 cd $HOME\AppData\Local\Continuum\miniconda3\envs\tap\Lib\site-packages\lcmap_tap
                 cp config-example.yaml config.yaml
