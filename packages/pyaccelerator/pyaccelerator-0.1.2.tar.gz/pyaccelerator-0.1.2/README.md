It usualy a good idea to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). To create a virtual environment in the `venv` folder (assuming python3):
```sh
python -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment:
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

Proceed with the installation to install in the virtual environment.

To deactivate the virtual environment:
```sh
deactivate
```

# Usage:
See the `notebooks` folder for some examples.
