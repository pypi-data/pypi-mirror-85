PYOSMAPI
=========
A OSM-Edit API Interface written in Python

Description
============
This Project is forked from repository osmate_ I saw the need to write my own code to access the OSM-API for editing.
My second requirement was to be able to use OAuth which I haven't found In any other Python OSM-API yet.


.. _osmate: https://github.com/jonycoo/osmate

Installation
=============
the project is now on pip, so now it is just as easy as

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyosmapi

after that import osm.osm_api

.. code:: python

    import pyosmapi.osm_api
    api = pyosmapi.osm_api.OsmApi()
    #init with '' or Fales access testserver (https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org)
    #by initializing OsmApi(True) you can access the live server
    api.get_current_user((<osm-username>, <osm-password>))

I wrote some documentation to every public method.
I've Implemented all methods from the API v0.6, excluding reduction
