# Socket Log Server

This is useful if you need to log from multipleprocesses into a single console
or file.

Unashamedly copied from
https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#network-logging and
packaged for convenience.


Install via pip:

    pip install logserver


And run with command:

    python3 -m logserver


Enjoy.
