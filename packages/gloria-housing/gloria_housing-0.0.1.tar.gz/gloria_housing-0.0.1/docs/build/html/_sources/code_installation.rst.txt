This section covers how to install code and run it in Visual 
studio code.

Cloning code from github directory
-------------------------------------
The code can be installed by cloning existing github repository.
You clone a repository with :file:`git clone <url>`. For example::
  $ git clone https://github.com/username/repository_name

Visual Studio Code
------------------
After cloning the github repository, the code can be run or modified 
by opening it in Visual Studio Code. Make sure Python extension is 
installed in Visual Studio Code.Open Command Palette and select “Run 
Python File in Terminal” (or just press the green arrow in the upper 
right corner) to run the code. 

You can also run just a part of your code. Select the code that you want 
to run (or, if you want a single line, place the cursor on that line) and 
run “Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal” command (or press Shift+Enter)
