        Have a complex library? 
        Want to either understand someone elses or make your library easier to understand? 
        
        What if you could generate a detailed graph of all the functions and classes in your package. Including links between common functions in multiple files. Now you can
        
        # External requirements
        - This requires the [graphviz library](https://graphviz.org/download/)
        
        # What files are taken into account?
        
        - .py
        - .ipynb (Jupyter notebook)
        
        # How to use?
        
        - cd to any directory you want
        - Default outputs are in pdf
        ```py
        import functionvis
        functionvis.mainrunner()
        ```
        - Change the format of the outputs
        ```py
        import functionvis
        functionvis.mainrunner(".", "svg")
        ```
        - Run for another directory
        ```py
        import functionvis
        functionvis.mainrunner("path-to-dir", "svg")
        ```
        
        # Outputs
        
        - Graph of all functions/classes and their related links

        - Extension can be configured
        - Saved in project dir
