        ```
        #!/usr/bin/env python
        from ecmwfapi import ECMWFDataServer
        
        # To run this example, you need an API key
        # available from https://api.ecmwf.int/v1/key/
        
        server = ECMWFDataServer()
        server.retrieve({
            'origin'    : "ecmf",
            'levtype'   : "sfc",
            'number'    : "1",
            'expver'    : "prod",
            'dataset'   : "tigge",
            'step'      : "0/6/12/18",
            'area'      : "70/-130/30/-60",
            'grid'      : "2/2",
            'param'     : "167",
            'time'      : "00/12",
            'date'      : "2014-11-01",
            'type'      : "pf",
            'class'     : "ti",
            'target'    : "tigge_2014-11-01_0012.grib"
