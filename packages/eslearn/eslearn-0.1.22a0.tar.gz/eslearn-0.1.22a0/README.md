Easylearn is designed for machine learning mainly in resting-state fMRI, radiomics and other fields (such as EEG). Easylearn is built on top of scikit-learn, pytorch and other packages. Easylearn can assist doctors and researchers who have limited coding experience to easily realize machine learning, e.g., (MR/CT/PET/EEG)imaging-marker- or other biomarker-based disease diagnosis and prediction, treatment response prediction, disease subtyping, dimensional decoding for transdiagnostic psychiatric diseases or other diseases, disease mechanism exploration and etc.  

We focus on machine learning rather than data preprocessing. Many software, such as SPM, GRETNA, DPABI, REST, RESTPlus, CCS, FSL, Freesufer, nipy, nipype, nibabel, fmriprep and etc, can be used for data preprocessing.

# Demo
Although, the GUI is under development, you can use simple commands to accomplish some machine learning tasks.  
The simplest demo is in the eslearn/examples.  
Below is a demo of training a model to classify insomnia patients using weighted functional connectivity strength as features (You can easily use other voxel-wise metrics as features, such as ReHo, ALFF).
This demo use svc as classifier, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as dimension reduction method and Recursive feature elimination (RFE) as feature selection method (inner cross-validation).
In each fold, this program will upper-resampling the training dataset to balance the cases with +1 labels and 0 labels.
