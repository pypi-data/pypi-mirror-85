Description: # jupyter_bokeh
        
        A Jupyter extension for rendering [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) content within Jupyter.  See also the separate [ipywidgets_bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/ipywidgets_bokeh) library for support for using Jupyter widgets/ipywidgets objects within Bokeh applications.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        * Jupyter Lab or Notebook
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install the latest version in Jupyter Lab:
        
        ```bash
        conda install -c bokeh jupyter_bokeh
        jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
        jupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh
        ```
        
        To install a specific version:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh@x.y.x
        ```
        
        On slow or limited memory systems, one can use `--minimize=False` to reduce compilation
        times or make Jupyter Lab build runtime bundles at all.
        
        jupyter_bokeh is automatically installed in Jupyter Notebook. In case of a non-standard
        setup, one can install the extensions with:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --py jupyter_bokeh
        jupyter nbextension enable jupyter_bokeh --py --sys-prefix
        ```
        
        ## Compatibility
        
        The core [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) library is generally version independent of
        [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) and this ``jupyter_bokeh`` extension
        for versions of ``bokeh>=2.0.0``.
        
        Our goal is that ``jupyter_bokeh`` minor releases (using the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) pattern) are
        made to follow JupyterLab minor release bumps and micro releases are for new ``jupyter_bokeh`` features
        or bug fix releases. We've been previously inconsistent with having the extension release minor version bumps
        track that of JupyterLab, so users seeking to find extension releases that are compatible with their JupyterLab
        installation may refer to the below table.
        
        ###### Compatible JupyterLab and `jupyter_bokeh` versions
        
        | JupyterLab    | `jupyter_bokeh`  |
        | ------------- | ---------------- |
        | 0.34.x        | 0.6.2            |
        | 0.35.x        | 0.6.3            |
        | 1.0.x         | 1.0.0            |
        | 2.0.x         | 2.0.0            |
        
        ## Development
        
        For a development install (requires npm version 6 or later), do the following in the repository directory:
        
        ```bash
        npm install
        jupyter labextension link .
        ```
        
        To rebuild the package and the JupyterLab app:
        
        ```bash
        npm run build
        jupyter lab build
        ```
        
        To incrementally rebuild the extension and JupyterLab after changes you can run
        
        ```bash
        npm run watch
        ```
        
        and in another terminal run
        
        ```bash
        jupyter lab --watch
        ```
        
        When making a new release for compatibility with a new JupyterLab minor release series, please make a minor
        release bump in this extension (i.e. 0.6.3 -> 0.7.0). Conversely, when creating a release for a new feature or bug fix,
        please make a micro release bump (i.e. 0.6.3 -> 0.6.4).
        
        ## Testing
        
        There is a directory named ``examples`` which contains a collection of notebooks that cover the various ``jupyter_bokeh``
        functionalities. If you update the extension for new JupyterLab releases, please manually execute each and check that the
        expected behavior occurs. If you extend the ``jupyter_bokeh``, please add a new notebook that covers the new functionality.
