(Python 3.6+)\n\nPython implementation of https://github.com/gocardless/business\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo get business, simply:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install business-python\n```\n\n### Getting started\n\nGet started with business by creating an instance of the calendar class, passing in a hash that specifies which days of the week are considered working days, and which days are holidays.\n\n```python\nfrom business.calendar import Calendar\n\ncalendar = Calendar(\n  working_days=["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"],\n  # array items are either parseable date strings, or real datetime.date objects\n  holidays=["January 1st, 2020", "April 10th, 2020"],\n  extra_working_dates=[],\n)\n```\n\n`extra_working_dates` key makes the calendar to consider a weekend day as a working day.\n\nA few calendar configs are bundled with the package (see [business/data](<(business/data)>) for details). Load them by calling the `load` class method on `Calendar`.\n\n```python\ncalendar = Calendar.load("weekdays")\n```\n\nIf `working_days` is missing, then common default is used (mon-fri).\nIf `holidays` is missing, "no holidays" assumed.\nIf `extra_working_dates` is missing, then no changes in `working_days` will happen.\n\nElements of `holidays` and `extra_working_dates` may be either strings that `Calendar.parse_date()` can understand, or YYYY-MM-DD (which is considered as a Date by Python YAML itself).\n\n```yaml\nholidays:\n  - 2017-01-08 # Same as January 8th, 2017\n```\n\nThe `load_cache` method allows a thread safe way to avoid reloading the same calendar multiple times, and provides a performant way to dynamically load calendars for different requests.\n\n```python\ncalendar = Calendar.load_cache("weekdays")\n```\n\n### Input data types\n\nThe `parse_date` method is used to process the input date(s) in each method and return a `datetime.date` object.\n\n```python\nCalendar.parse_date("2019-01-01")\n# => datetime.date(2019, 1, 1)\n```\n\nSupported data types are:\n\n- `datetime.date`\n- `datetime.datetime`\n- `pandas.Timestamp` (treated as `datetime.datetime`)\n- date string parseable by [`dateutil.parser.parse`](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html#dateutil.parser.parse)\n\n`numpy.datetime64` is not supported, but can be converted to `datetime.date`:\n\n```python\nnumpy.datetime64(\'2014-06-01T23:00:05.453000000\').astype(\'M8[D]\').astype(\'O\')\n# =>  datetime.date(2014, 6, 1)\n```\n\n### Checking for business days\n\nTo check whether a given date is a business day (falls on one of the specified working days or extra working dates, and is not a holiday), use the `is_business_day` method on `Calendar`.\n\n```python\ncalendar.is_business_day("Monday, 8 June 2020")\n# => true\ncalendar.is_business_day("Sunday, 7 June 2020")\n# => false\n```\n\n### Custom calendars\n\nTo use a calendar you\'ve written yourself, you need to add the directory it\'s stored in as an additional calendar load path:\n\n```python\nCalendar.additional_load_paths = [\'path/to/your/calendar/directory\']\n```\n\nYou can then load the calendar as normal.\n\n### Business day arithmetic\n\n> For our purposes, date-based calculations are sufficient. Supporting time-based calculations as well makes the code significantly more complex. We chose to avoid this extra complexity by sticking solely to date-based mathematics.\n\nThe `add_business_days` method is used to perform business day arithmetic on dates.\n\n```python\ninput_date = Calendar.parse_date("Thursday, 12 June 2014")\ncalendar.add_business_days(input_date, 4).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Wednesday, 18 June 2014"\ncalendar.add_business_days(input_date, -4).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Friday, 06 June 2014"\n```\n\nThe `roll_forward` and `roll_backward` methods snap a date to a nearby business day. If provided with a business day, they will return that date. Otherwise, they will advance (forward for `roll_forward` and backward for `roll_backward`) until a business day is found.\n\n```python\ninput_date = Calendar.parse_date("Saturday, 14 June 2014")\ncalendar.roll_forward(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Monday, 16 June 2014"\ncalendar.roll_backward(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Friday, 13 June 2014"\n```\n\nIn contrast, the `next_business_day` and `previous_business_day` methods will always move to a next or previous date until a business day is found, regardless if the input provided is a business day.\n\n```python\ninput_date = Calendar.parse_date("Monday, 9 June 2014")\ncalendar.roll_forward(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Monday, 09 June 2014"\ncalendar.next_business_day(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Tuesday, 10 June 2014"\ncalendar.previous_business_day(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Friday, 06 June 2014"\n```\n\nTo count the number of business days between two dates, pass the dates to `business_days_between`. This method counts from start of the first date to start of the second date. So, assuming no holidays, there would be two business days between a Monday and a Wednesday.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ninput_date = Calendar.parse_date("Saturday, 14 June 2014")\ncalendar.business_days_between(input_date, input_date + timedelta(days=7))\n# => 5\n```\n\nThe `get_business_day_of_month` method return the running total of business days for a given date in that month. This method counts the number of business days from the start of the first day of the month to the given input date.\n\n```python\ninput_date = Calendar.parse_date("Thursday, 12 June 2014")\ncalendar.get_business_day_of_month(input_date)\n# => 9\n```\n\n### Included Calendars\n\nWe include some calendar data with this package but give no guarantees of its accuracy.
