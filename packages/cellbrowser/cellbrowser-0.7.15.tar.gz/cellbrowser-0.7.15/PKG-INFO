Description: The UCSC Cell Browser is an interactive browser for
            single cell data, like mRNA or ATAC-seq data. You can display
            dimensionality reductions, navigate them with the mouse or the cursor keys,
            select cells, color by genes or meta annotations and make many other
            changes. The main site runs at https://cells.ucsc.edu, but using this
            package you can also convert data yourself and build a Cell Browser HTML
            directory that can be served through any University webserver. You can try
            the Cell Browser at https://cells.ucsc.edu or read about how to convert
            data with this package on https://cellbrowser.rtfd.org.
