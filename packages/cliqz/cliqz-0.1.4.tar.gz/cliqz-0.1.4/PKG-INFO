Description: # Cliqz Intro
        
        I wanted to knock this out in a day to solve a problem I had no time budgeted for. Python was the perfect option but I'm a n00b to it, so be cruel.
        
        The other quizzes I use, like Anki-droid and Udemy quizzes are not open-source-ish enough. There is some difficulty adding question sets and types. I want questions in a data format that is more verifiable and standard.
        
        We all need to learn, so maybe we can learn to trade our learning and the product of our learning.
        
        ## Inspiration
        
        I was inspired yesterday by this article: [How to Build And Publish Command-Line Applications With Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-and-publish-command-line-applications-with-python-96065049abc1)
        
        ## Quiz Schema
        
        The Quiz structure is starting to look like this:
        
        ```yaml
        description: string
        duration_minutes: number
        questions:
        - item:
          title: string
          type: [missing_items choose_items]
          false_choices: [text_string_one text_string_two text_string_three]
          valid_choices: [text_string_one]
          notes: >
            Multiline text
        ```
        
        
        ## Roadmap
