``JamPy`` is a Python implementation of the Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM)
formalism for the dynamical modelling of galaxies. 

This software can be used e.g. to measure the mass of supermassive black holes 
in galaxies, to infer their dark-matter content or to measure galaxy masses and
density profiles.

The method calculates all the first and second velocity moments, for both the
intrinsic and the projected kinematics, in spherical and axisymmetric geometry.

The JAM solution assuming a cylindrically-oriented velocity ellipsoid was introduced in 
`Cappellari (2008) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.390...71C>`_,
while the solution assuming a spherically-oriented velocity ellipsoid was introduced in 
`Cappellari (2020) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.4819C>`_

Installation
------------

install with::

    pip install jampy

Without writing access to the global ``site-packages`` directory, use::

    pip install --user jampy

To upgrade ``JamPy`` to the latest version use::

    pip install --upgrade jampy

Documentation
-------------

Full documentation is contained in the individual files headers.

Usage examples are contained in the directory  ``jampy/examples``, which is
copied by ``pip`` within the global ``site-packages`` folder.

What follows is the documentation of the two main procedures of the ``JamPy``
package, extracted from their Python docstrings. The other procedures are 
documented in their respective docstrings.

The older ``JamPy`` routines ``jam_axi_rms``, ``jam_axi_vel`` and
``jam_sph_rms``, from version < v6.0, are still available, but I moved 
them to the ``jampy.legacy`` folder. They are generally redundant, but 
can be imported from ``jampy.legacy`` and used like before.
