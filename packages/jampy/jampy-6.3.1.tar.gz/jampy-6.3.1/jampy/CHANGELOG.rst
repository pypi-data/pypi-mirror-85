Changelog
=========

V6.3.1: MC, Oxford, 11 November 2020
    - ``jam_axi_proj``: New keyword ``analytic_los`` to chose between numeric
      or analytic line-of-sight integral for the second velocity moment,
      when ``align='cyl'``.
    - ``jam_axi_proj``: Increased default value of ``nlos`` keyword.
    - ``jam_axi_proj``: Raise an error if ``rbh`` is too small.
    - ``jam_axi_proj`` and ``jam_axi_intr``: Removed ``**kwargs`` argument and
      included new ``nodots`` keyword passed to ``plot_velfield``.

V6.2.1: MC, Oxford, 15 September 2020
    - ``jam_axi_proj``: Fixed program stop when ``data == ml == None``.
      Thank to Bitao Wang (pku.edu.cn) for reporting.

V6.2.0: MC, Oxford, 17 August 2020
    - ``jam_axi_proj``: Avoid possible division by zero after convolution,
      when the tracer MGE is much smaller than the field of view.
    - ``jam_axi_proj``: Fully broadcasted ``vmom_proj``.
    - ``jam_axi_proj``: Removed minimum-radius clipping in ``vmom_proj``.
    - ``jam_axi_proj``: New ``interp`` keyword to force no-interpolation
      when using the full first and second velocity moments simultaneously.
    - Made ``jam.plot()`` callable after ``jam_axi_proj`` or ``jam_axi_intr``.
    - New axisymmetric analytic vs MGE test in ``mge_vcirc_example``.
    - ``mge_vcirc``: Upgraded formalism.
    - Fixed Numpy 1.9 ``VisibleDeprecationWarning``.
    - Updated documentation.

V6.1.5: MC, Oxford, 23 July 2020
    - Fixed program stop in first velocity moment without input data,
      introduced in V6.1.2. Thanks to Bitao Wang (pku.edu.cn) for reporting.
    - Implemented the ``kappa`` input keyword as scalar.

V6.1.4: MC, Oxford, 16 July 2020
    - Added ``kappa`` to the returned parameters of ``jam_axi_proj``.
    - Compute both velocity and Vrms in ``jam_axi_proj_example``.

V6.1.3: MC, Oxford, 13 July 2020
    - Fixed program stop in ``legacy.jam_axi_vel`` due to a variable name typo 
      introduced in V6.1.2.

V6.1.2: MC, Oxford, 20 June 2020
    - ``jam_axi_proj``: Fixed input ``ml`` being ignored. Thanks to Sabine
      Thater (univie.ac.at) and Takafumi Tsukui (grad.nao.ac.jp) for reporting.
    - ``jam_axi_rms``: I reduced the interpolation error before the PSF
      convolution for all the rotines in the ``legacy`` sub-folder, as already
      implemented in the new ``jam_axi_proj``. Thanks to Takafumi Tsukui
      (grad.nao.ac.jp) for reporting differences.
    - ``jam_axi_intr``: Request input ``data = [sigR, sigz, sigphi, vrms_phi]``
      instead of ``data = [sigR, sigz, sigphi, vphi]``.
    - ``jam_axi_intr``: exclude ``sigphi`` from ``ml`` fitting. These two
      changes make the fitted ``ml`` strictly independent of the adopted
      tangential anisotropy ``gamma``.

V6.0.1: MC, Oxford, 23 April 2020
    - Fixed ``model`` output when fitting ``ml``.
      Thanks to Selina Nitschai (mpia-hd.mpg.de) for reporting.

V6.0.0: MC, Oxford, 22 April 2020
    - Major changes to the whole ``jampy`` package: from this version
      I include the new spherically-aligned solution of the Jeans 
      equations from Cappellari (2020, MNRAS).
    - Two new functions ``jam_axi_intr`` and ``jam_axi_proj``
      now provide either the intrinsic or the projected moments,
      respectively, for both the spherically-aligned and 
      cylindrically-aligned JAM solutions.
    - I moved the previous procedures ``jam_axi_rms``, ``jam_axi_vel``
      and ``jam_sph_rms`` to the ``jampy.legacy`` folder.
