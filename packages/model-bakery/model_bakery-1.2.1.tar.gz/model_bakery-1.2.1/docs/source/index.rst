Model Bakery: Smart fixtures for better tests
=============================================

Model Bakery offers you a smart way to create fixtures for testing in Django.

With a simple and powerful API you can create many objects with a single line of code.

Model Bakery is a rename of the legacy `model_mommy's project <https://pypi.org/project/model_mommy/>`_. This is because the project's creator and maintainers decided to not reinforce gender stereotypes for women in technology. You can read more about this subject `here <https://witi.com/articles/1017/How-Gender-Stereotypes-are-Still-Affecting-Women-in-Tech/>`_.


Compatibility
=============

model_bakery supports Django >= 1.11

Install
=======

Install it with ``pip``

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install model_bakery
