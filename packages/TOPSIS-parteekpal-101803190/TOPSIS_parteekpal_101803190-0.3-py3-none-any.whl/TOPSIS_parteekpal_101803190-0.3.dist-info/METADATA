## What is TOPSIS

TOPSIS stands for â€˜The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solutionâ€™ is a multi-criteria decision analysis(MCDA) method. 
It is a method of compensatory aggregation that compares a set of alternatives by identifying weights for each criterion, 
normalising scores for each criterion and calculating the geometric distance between each alternative and the ideal alternative, 
which is the best score in each criterion.
