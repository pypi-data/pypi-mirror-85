Description: This is an abomination. I inherited a WordPress blog with the [Fusion Page
        Builder] plugin installed. When I wanted to use the WordPress XML export file
        to move to a static site generator the post text was littered with lots of
        Fusion tags and codes. I wanted to parse them out into a DOM like tree
        structure and also strip them out. 
        
        ### Install
        
        ```
        pip3 install fusionbuilder
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        ```python
        import fusionbuilder
        root, text = fusionbuilder.parse(text)
        ```
        
        ### Test
        
        ```
        pytest test_fusionbuilder.py
        ```
