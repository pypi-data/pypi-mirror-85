A generic part file is expected when the ``-r generic`` option is specified.
It contains the following items:

#. The part name or number stands alone on row.
   The following five cells on the same row can contain:
       #. A reference prefix such as ``R`` (defaults to ``U`` if left blank),
       #. A footprint such as ``Diodes_SMD:D_0603`` (defaults to blank),
       #. A manufacturer's part number such as ``MT48LC16M16A2F4-6A:GTR`` (defaults to blank).
       #. A link to the part's datasheet.
       #. A description of the part.
#. The next non-blank row contains the column headers. The required headers are 'Pin' and 'Name'.
   Optional columns are 'Unit', 'Side', 'Type', 'Style', and 'Hidden'.
   These can be placed in any order and in any column.
#. On each succeeding row, enter the pin number, name, unit identifier (if the schematic symbol will have multiple units),
   pin type and style. Each of these items should be entered in the column with the appropriate header.

   * Pin numbers can be either numeric (e.g., '69') if the part is a DIP or QFP, or they can be
     alphanumeric (e.g., 'C10') if a BGA or CSP is used. Using a `*` instead of a pin number
     creates a non-existent "gap" pin that can be used to visually separate the pins into groups. (This only works
     when the ``-s row`` sorting option is selected.)
   * Pin names can be any combination of letters, numbers and special characters (except a comma).
   * The unit identifier can be blank or any combination of letters, numbers and special characters (except a comma).
     A separate unit will be generated in the schematic symbol for each distinct unit identifier.
   * The side column specifies the side of the symbol the pin will be placed on. The allowable values are:
        * left
        * right
        * top
        * bottom
   * The type column specifies the electrical type of the pin. The allowable values are:
        * input, inp, in, clk
        * output, outp, out
        * bidirectional, bidir, bi, inout, io, iop
        * tristate, tri
        * passive, pass
        * unspecified, un, analog
        * power_in, pwr_in, pwrin, power, pwr, ground, gnd
        * power_out, pwr_out, pwrout, pwr_o
        * open_collector, opencollector, open_coll, opencoll, oc
        * open_emitter, openemitter, open_emit, openemit, oe
        * no_connect, noconnect, no_conn, noconn, nc
   * The style column specifies the graphic representation of the pin. The allowable pin styles are:
        * line, <blank>
        * inverted, inv, ~, #
        * clock, clk, rising_clk
        * inverted_clock, inv_clk, clk_b, clk_n, ~clk, #clk
        * input_low, inp_low, in_lw, in_b, in_n, ~in, #in
        * clock_low, clk_low, clk_lw, clk_b, clk_n, ~clk, #clk
        * output_low, outp_low, out_lw, out_b, out_n, ~out, #out
        * falling_edge_clock, falling_clk, fall_clk
        * non_logic, nl, analog
   * The hidden column specifies whether the pin is visible in Eeschema. This can be one of 'y', 'yes', 't', 'true',
     or '1' to make it invisible, anything else makes it visible.

#. A blank row ends the list of pins for the part.
#. Multiple parts (each consisting of name, column header and pin rows)
   separated by blank lines are allowed in a single CSV file.
   Each part will become a separate symbol in the KiCad library.

When the option ``-r xilinx7`` is used, the individual pin files or entire .zip archives
for the `Xilinx 7-Series FPGAs <http://www.xilinx.com/support/packagefiles/>`_ can be processed.

When the option ``-r stm32cube`` is used, the input file should be the
pin layout file exported from the STM32CubeMx tool. To create this
file, create a project with STM32CubeMx and then from window menu select
"Pinout -> Generate CSV pinout text file". If you select pin features
or define labels for pins these will be reflected in the generated
library symbol.

When the option ``-r lattice`` is used, the input file should come from the Lattice website.

The ``-s`` option specifies the arrangement of the pins in the schematic symbol:

* ``-s row`` places the pins in the order they were entered into the file.
* ``-s name`` places the pins in increasing order of their names.
* ``-s num`` places the pins in increasing order of their pin numbers
  and arranged in a counter-clockwise fashion around the symbol starting from
  the upper-left corner.

The ``--reverse`` option reverses the sort order for the pins.

Using the ``--side`` option you can set the default side for the
pins. The option from the file will override the command line
option. The default choice is ``left``.

Specifying the ``-f`` option enables *fuzzy matching* on the pin types, styles and sides used in the
CSV file.
So, for example, ``ck`` would match ``clk`` or ``rgt`` would match ``right``.

Specifying the ``-b`` option will place multiple pins with the identical names at the same location
such that they can all attach to the same net with a single connection.
This is helpful for handling the multiple VCC and GND pins found on many high pin-count devices.

The ``-w`` option is used to overwrite an existing library with any new parts
from the file. The old contents of the library are lost.

The ``-a`` option is used to add parts to an existing library.
If a part with the same name already exists, the new part will only overwrite it
if the ``-w`` flag is also used.
Any existing parts in the library that are not overwritten are retained.

Specifying the ``--fill`` option will determine how schematic boxes are filled:

* ``no_fill``: Default. Schematic symbols are created with no filled boxes.
* ``fg_fill``: Schematic boxes will be foreground filled
* ``bg_fill``: Schematic boxes will be background filled. (This is the default.)

The ``--box_line_width`` option sets the linewidth of the schematic symbol
box in units of mils. The default setting is zero.

The ``--push`` option affects the positions of the pins on each side of the
schematic symbol box. A value of 0.0 pushes them to the upper-most or left-most
position on the left/right or top/bottom sides. A value of 1.0 pushes them to
the bottom-most or right-most position on the left-right or top-bottom sides.
A value of 0.5 (the default) centers them.

Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^

KiPart can handle single or multiple input files.
The simplest case is generating a symbol library from a single CSV file.
The following command will process the ``file.csv`` file and place the 
symbols in ``file.lib``:: 

    kipart file.csv

This also works with multiple input files with a separate library created
for each CSV file::

    kipart file1.csv file2.csv  # Creates file1.lib and file2.lib.

Symbols from multiple CSV files can be placed into a single library using the ``-o`` option::

    kipart file1.csv file2.csv -o total.lib

If ``total.lib`` already exists, the previous command will report that
the file cannot be overwritten. Use the ``-w`` option to force
the overwrite::

    kipart file1.csv file2.csv -w -o total.lib

Symbol libraries can also be built incrementally by appending symbols
generated from CSV files::

    kipart file3.csv file4.csv -a -o total.lib

Assume the following data for a single-unit part is placed into the `example.csv` file::

    example_part

    Pin,    Type,           Name
    23,     input,          A5
    90,     output,         B1
    88,     bidirectional,  C3
    56,     tristate,       D22
    84,     tristate,       D3
    16,     power_in,       VCC
    5,      power_in,       GND
    29,     power_in,       VCC
    98,     power_in,       GND
    99,     power_in,       VCC
    59,     power_in,       GND

Then the command ``kipart example.csv -o example1.lib`` will create a schematic symbol
where the pins are arranged in the order of the rows in the CSV file they are on:

.. image:: example1.png

The command ``kipart -s num example.csv -o example2.lib`` will create a schematic symbol
where the pins are arranged by their pin numbers:

.. image:: example2.png

The command ``kipart -s name example.csv -o example3.lib`` will create a schematic symbol
where the pins are arranged by their names:

.. image:: example3.png

The command ``kipart -b example.csv -o example4.lib`` will bundle power pins with
identical names (like ``GND`` and ``VCC``) into single pins like so:

.. image:: example4.png

Or you could divide the part into two units: one for I/O pins and the other for power pins
by adding a ``Unit`` column like this::

    example_part

    Pin,    Unit,   Type,           Name
    23,     IO,     input,          A5
    90,     IO,     output,         B1
    88,     IO,     bidirectional,  C3
    56,     IO,     tristate,       D22
    84,     IO,     tristate,       D3
    16,     PWR,    power_in,       VCC
    5,      PWR,    power_in,       GND
    29,     PWR,    power_in,       VCC
    98,     PWR,    power_in,       GND
    99,     PWR,    power_in,       VCC
    59,     PWR,    power_in,       GND

Then the command ``kipart -b example.csv -o example5.lib`` results in a part symbol having two separate units:

.. image:: example5_1.png

.. image:: example5_2.png

As an alternative, you could go back to a single unit with all the inputs on the left side,
all the outputs on the right side, the ``VCC`` pins on the top and the ``GND`` pins on the bottom::

    example_part

    Pin,    Unit,   Type,           Name,   Side
    23,     1,      input,          A5,     left
    90,     1,      output,         B1,     right
    88,     1,      bidirectional,  C3,     left
    56,     1,      tristate,       D22,    right
    84,     1,      tristate,       D3,     right
    16,     1,      power_in,       VCC,    top
    5,      1,      power_in,       GND,    bottom
    29,     1,      power_in,       VCC,    top
    98,     1,      power_in,       GND,    bottom
    99,     1,      power_in,       VCC,    top
    59,     1,      power_in,       GND,    bottom

Running the command ``kipart -b example.csv -o example6.lib`` generates a part symbol with pins on all four sides:

.. image:: example6.png

If the input file has a ``Hidden`` column, then some, none, or all pins can be made invisible::

    a_part_with_secrets

    Pin,    Name,   Type,   Side,   Style,      Hidden
    1,      N.C.,   in,     left,   clk_low,    Y
    2,      GND,    pwr,    left,   ,           yes
    3,      SS_INH, in,     left,   ,           True
    4,      OSC,    in,     left,   ,
    5,      A1,     out,    right,  ,           False

In the Part Library Editor, hidden pins are grayed out:

.. image:: hidden_editor.png

But in Eeschema, they won't be visible at all:

.. image:: hidden_eeschema.png


kilib2csv
------------------

Sometimes you have existing libraries that you want to manage with a spreadsheet
instead of the KiCad symbol editor.
The kilib2csv utility takes one or more library files and converts them
into a CSV file.
Then the CSV file can be manipulated with a spreadsheet and used as input to KiPart.
**(Note that any stylized part symbol graphics will be lost in the conversion.
KiPart only supports boring, box-like part symbols.)**

::

    usage: kilib2csv [-h] [-v] [-o [file.csv]] [-a] [-w] file.lib [file.lib ...]

    Convert a KiCad schematic symbol library file into a CSV file for KiPart.

    positional arguments:
      file.lib              KiCad schematic symbol library.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
      -o [file.csv], --output [file.csv]
                            CSV file created from schematic library file.
      -a, --append          Append to an existing CSV file.
      -w, --overwrite       Allow overwriting of an existing CSV file.

This utility handles single and multiple input files in the same manner
as KiPart and supports some of the same options for overwriting and appending
to the output CSV file::

    kilib2csv my_lib1.lib my_lib2.lib -o my_library.csv

Then you can generate a consistent library from the CSV file::

    kipart my_library.csv -o my_library_new.lib
