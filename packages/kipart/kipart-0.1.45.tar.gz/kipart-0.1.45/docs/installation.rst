============

This is a Python package, so you'll need to have Python installed to use it.
If you're using linux, you probably already have Python.
If you're on Windows, you can download a Python installer from
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads#windows>`_ ,
`Active State <https://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads>`_ , or even
`WinPython <http://winpython.github.io/#releases>`_ .

Once you have Python, you can install this package by opening a terminal
window and typing the command::

    $ easy_install kipart

Or::

    $ pip install kipart
