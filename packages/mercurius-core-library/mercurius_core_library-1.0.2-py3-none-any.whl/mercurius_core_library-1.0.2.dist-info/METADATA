# Mercurius Core Python Library

Mercurius Core Python Library is a repository of reusable Python components to be shared with Python projects integrating the Mercurius RESTful API server.

These components have minimal dependencies on other libraries, so that they can be deployed easily.  In addition, these components will keep their interfaces as stable as possible, so that other Python projects can integrate these components without having to worry about changes in the future.

To install the Mercurius Core Python Library, enter the follow command line:

```bash
$ pipenv install mercurius-core-library
```
