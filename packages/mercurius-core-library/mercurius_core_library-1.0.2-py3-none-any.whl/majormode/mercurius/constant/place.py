    # etc.)

    # locate this particular place.  House numbering schemes vary by
    # place, and in many cases even within cities.  In some areas of the
    # world, including many remote areas, houses are not numbered at all,
    # instead simply being named.  In some other areas, this numbering can
    # be composed of a first number along the street followed by a second
    # the number along intersecting street, or they would adopt a system
    # where the city is divided into small sections each with its own
    # numeric code.  The houses within that zone are then labeled based on
    # the order in which they were constructed, or clockwise around the
    # block.

    # # 3166-1 alpha-2 code (referencing the country that this language might
    # # be specific to).  For example: eng (which denotes a standard English),
