        setuptools-twine
        ================
        
        This package adds ``twine_check`` and ``twine_upload`` commands to ``setuptools``. These commands are equivalent to running |twine_check|_ or |twine_upload|_, but always operate on the latest source distribution and wheel generated by ``setup.py sdist`` and ``setup.py bdist_wheel``.
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        Install with pip::
        
          pip install setuptools-twine
        
        If you only want to simply your workflow that currently uses |twine_check|_ or |twine_upload|_, you can invoke the ``setup.py`` commands manually::
        
          python setup.py twine_check
          python setup.py twine_upload
        
        Note that you no longer need to specify the ``dist/*`` files as with |twine_check|_ or |twine_upload|_; they are determined automatically from the results of the ``sdist`` and ``bdist_wheel`` commands.
        
        Advanced Usage
        --------------
        
        If you're a package author or maintainer looking to automate even more, you can add ``setuptools-twine`` as a |setup_requires|_ dependency in your project's ``setup.cfg``::
        
          [options]
          setup_requires =
              setuptools-twine
        
        Then, create an |alias|_ command to encapsulate multiple ``setup.py`` commands in one::
        
          [aliases]
          pypi_upload = clean sdist bdist_wheel twine_check twine_upload
        
        Now, you can build, check, and upload with a single command::
        
          python setup.py pypi_upload
        
        Roadmap
        -------
        
        * Allow passing additional options to ``twine_check`` and ``twine_upload`` commands.
        * Allow using only source distributions or wheels, instead of both.
        * Allow uploading other output formats in addition to source distributions and wheels.
