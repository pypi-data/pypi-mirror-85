Description: # TOPSIS-GARVIT-101803122
        
        TOPSIS-GARVIT-101803122 is a package that will provide feature to do multi-criteria decision making in choosing the best models among the data provided.
        
          - It will provide with the TOPSIS Score.
          - It will do Ranking of Models on the basis of the given data.
        
        # TOPSIS:
        
        Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) originated in the 1980s as a multi-criteria decision making method. TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution, and greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution. 
        
        
        ### Installation
        TOPSIS-GARVIT-101803122 requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) v2.7+ to run.
        
        Install the package using pip as follows :
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install TOPSI-GARVIT-101803122
        ```

        TOPSIS-GARVIT-10803122 can be run as in the following examples:
        
        
        
        
        ### Sample Dataset
        The decision matrix (a) will be extracted from the csv file as the pandas dataframe which will contain each row representing a Model alternative, and each column representing a criterion like Accuracy, RSeq, Root Mean Squared Error, Correlation, and many more.
        
        | Model | Correlation | RSeq | RMSE | Accuracy
        | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- | --------
        | M1 | 0.79 | 0.62 | 1.25 | 60.89 
        | M2 | 0.66 | 0.44 | 2.89 | 63.07
        | M3 | 0.56 | 0.31 | 1.57 | 62.87
        | M4 | 0.82 | 0.67 | 2.68 | 70.19
        | M5 | 0.75 | 0.56 | 1.3 | 80.39
        
        Weights (w) is not already normalised will be normalised later in the code.
        Information of impacts positive(+) or negative(-) impact criteria should be provided in (im).
