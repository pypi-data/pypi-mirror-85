audiomath is a package for Python programmers who want to record, manipulate,
visualize or play sound waveforms. It allows you to:

- Represent sounds as numeric arrays via the third-party Python package `numpy`
  (required). The arrays are contained within high-level objects, allowing common
  operations to be performed with minimal coding---for example: slicing and
  concatenation in time, selection and stacking of channels, resampling, mixing,
  rescaling and modulation.

- Plot the resulting waveforms, via the third-party Python package `matplotlib`
  (optional).

- Read and write uncompressed `.wav` files (via the Python standard library).

- Read other audio formats using the third-party AVbin library (binaries are
  included in the package, for a selection of platforms).

- Record and play back sounds using the third-party PortAudio library (binaries
  are included in the package, for a selection of platforms).

- Play sounds using the alternative PsychPortAudio back-end, from the (optional)
  `psychtoolbox` package, allowing very precise control of latency

- Plug in other recording/playback back-ends with moderate development effort.
