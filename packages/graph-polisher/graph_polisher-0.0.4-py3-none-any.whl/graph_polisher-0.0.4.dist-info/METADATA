# graph-polisher

Graph polisher is a library that helps you clean your plotly figures. 
This library was inspired by the book "Storytelling with Data by Cole
Nussbaumer Knaflic (https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/storytelling-with-data).

## Installation

```

## Testing

## Notebooks for examples

You can use this to see how the library modifies the plots. We are using 
[unnotebook](http://www.unnotebook.com/) to plot the examples.

```bash
docker build . -t graph-polisher
```

2. Run notebook

```shell script
docker-compose up notebook
```

or 

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    -v /Users/rigo/Documents/Projects/notebooks/stock-predictions:/notebooks \
    -p 8899:8899 unclutterer
```
