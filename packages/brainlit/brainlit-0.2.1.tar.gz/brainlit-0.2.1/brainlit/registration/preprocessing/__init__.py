    Perform each preprocessing function in processes, in the order listed,
    on data if it is an array, or on each element in data if it is a list of arrays.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray, list): The array or list of arrays to be preprocessed.
        processes (list): The list of strings, each corresponding to the name of a preprocessing function.
        process_kwargs (seq, optional): A sequence of dictionaries containing kwargs for each element of processes. Defaults to None.

    Raises:
        TypeError: Raised if data is a list whose elements are not all of type np.ndarray.
        TypeError: Raised if data is neither a np.ndarray or a list of np.ndarrays.
        TypeError: Raised if an element of processes is neither a single string nor an iterable.
        ValueError: Raised if an element of processes is an iterable but not of length 2.
        ValueError: Raised if an alement of processes is a 2-element iterable whose first element is not a string.
        ValueError: Raised if an alement of processes is a 2-element iterable whose second element is not a dictionary.
        TypeError: Raised if an element of processes includes a dictionary with a key that is not a string.
        ValueError: Raised if any element of processes is not a recognized preprocessing function.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray, list: A copy of data after having each function in processes applied.
