Poisson Approval studies the Poisson Game of Approval Voting.


* Free software: GNU General Public License v3
* Documentation: https://poisson-approval.readthedocs.io.

--------
Features
--------

* Implement only the case of 3 candidates.
* Deal with ordinal or cardinal profiles.
* Compute the asymptotic developments of the probability of pivot events when the number of players tends to infinity.
* Compute the best response to a given tau-vector.
* Explore automatically a grid of ordinal profiles or a grid of tau-vectors.
* Perform Monte-Carlo experiments on profiles or tau-vectors.
* Search an equilibrium by iterated voting or fictitious play.
* In addition to Approval, implement Plurality and Anti-plurality as Poisson games.
* Perform numeric or symbolic computation.
