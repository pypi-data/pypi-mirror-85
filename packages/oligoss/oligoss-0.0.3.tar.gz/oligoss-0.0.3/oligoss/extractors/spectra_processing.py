    """
    Takes a list of spectra in ripper format, groups into a single consensus
    spectrum and then returns the calculated MA of that consensus spectrum.

    Args:
        spectra (List[dict]): list of ripper spectra.
        ppm_window (float): error window for grouping peaks by m/z
            (units = ppm).
        intensity_grouping (str): specifies whether final intensities of grouped
            peaks in consensus spectrum should equal the sum or mean of
            individual peak intensities. NOTE: must be either "sum" or "mean" to
            specify mean or summed intensities, respectively.
        min_rel_intensity (float): minimum relative intensity for peaks to
            be considered. NOTE: must be decimal fraction in range 0 -> 1.
        min_abs_intensity (float): minimum absolute intensity for peaks to be
            considered.
        min_peak_identity (float): minimum % of spectra for peaks to be present
            in to be included in final consensus spectrum. NOTE: this must
            be expressed as a decimal fraction in range 0 -> 1.

    Returns:
        float: MA value for consensus spectrum (number of unique peaks after
            binning and intensity thresholding).
