Section 2: Adducts

This section contains information on common cationic and anionic adducts.
CATIONS and ANIONS contain information on positive and negative ions,
respectively. The general format of these dictionaries is as follows:
{f'{symbol}' : (mass, min_z, max_z)} where symbol = atomic symbol or chemical
formula, mass = monoisotopic mass, min_z and max_z = minimum and maximum
absolute charge for a single adduct, respectively
