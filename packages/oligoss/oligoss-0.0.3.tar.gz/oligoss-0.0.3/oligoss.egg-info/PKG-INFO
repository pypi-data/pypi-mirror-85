Description: # Oligomer Soup Sequencing (OLIGOSS)
        
        OLIGOSS is a package for _de novo_ sequencing of linear oligomers from
        tandem mass spectrometry data.
        
        Full documentation can be found here: https://croningroup.gitlab.io/origins/oligoss/index.html
        
        __Note__: proper use of this package requires a good working knowledge of both
        the chemistry and analytical methods used to obtain results. It is __not__ a
        magic bullet to solve all of your oligomer sequencing needs! Please ensure that
        all raw mass spectrometry data input to the package is of good quality. All
        results should be checked and validated wherever possible, especially if running
        data from a new instrument and / or oligomer class.
        
        ## Installation
        
        OLIGOSS is available through Pip (Python Package Index):
        
        ```
        pip install oligoss --user
        
        ```
