        - Say Process P0 uses cuda:0 and P1 uses cuda:1. In this function, the data is pickled and converted
          to a tensor on current gpu before calling dist.all_gather(). Data from P0 (say D0) has device cuda:0 and
          data from P1 (say D1) has device cuda:1.
        - During the dist.all_gather() call, data is moved to the target gpu on which it is requested.
          After dist.all_gather() call, P0 gets [D0, D1] in tensor_list and both of them have device "cuda:0".
          P1 gets [D0, D1] in tensor_list and both of them have device "cuda:1".
        - When some values in data are on gpu, the dist.all_gather() does not move those values to the target gpu.
          This results in memory on a gpu being accessed by two processes, which results in deadlocks and stuck runs.
