    This release includes below changes:

    - Transition to flake8 2.6.x:

      * flake8 2.6.x performed the conversion to pycodestyle (which is
        the new name of pep8). Remove the explicit dependencies of
        hacking as flake8 is going to pull in mccabe, pyflakes and
        pycodestyle in the versions that are needed.

    - Allow 'wraps' to be an alternative to autospec:

      * Don't cause an H210 error if the mock.patch/mock.patch.object call uses
        the 'wraps' keyword. As that serves the same purpose in catching wrong
        attributes.
