class RC4PrependAttack(object):
    """
    Performs a plaintext recovery attack.

    The RC4PrependAttack uses an ChosenPlaintextOracle that prepends the payload and then encrypts the whole message with a randomly generated key.
    The attack uses specific byte biases found in the RC4 keystream and feeds the plaintext into these locations. Using the law of large numbers,
    the keystream bias will surface, and we can XOR it with the ciphertext to return the plaintext. This specific implementation uses several optmizations.
    The first is concurrency/parallelism and is self-explanatory. The second is the use of concurrent biases. We first determine which biases we can still use
    in the attack. This is necessary since we can only feed the plaintext forward, so plaintext index five is not eligible to use RC4 bias index two. Next, we determine
    which biases are "active". If the plaintext is 20 characters long, and the current padding position is 0, then we can utilize both RC4 bias indices 2 and 16 (i.e. 1 and 15 using a zero-based-index).
    Lastly, we introduce "branches". If a byte happens to decrypted more than one and has different outcomes, we keep both. At the end, we return the Cartesian product of all
    byte decryptions. This will normally just be one.

    Conditions:
        * RC4 is being used
        * The user has access to an oracle that encrypts user-controlled plaintext and a secret under a random key
        * The user-controlled plaintext is prepended to the secret
