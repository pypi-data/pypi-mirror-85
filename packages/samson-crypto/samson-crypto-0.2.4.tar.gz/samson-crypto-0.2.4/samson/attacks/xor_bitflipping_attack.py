class XORBitflippingAttack(object):
    """
    Performs a plaintext manipulation attack.

    CTR/stream ciphers will XOR the keystream with the ciphertext to decrypt the data. By injecting known plaintext,
    we can recover that block's keystream and XOR in our own plaintext. While this may seem extraneous given
    we can already inject a payload, this particular attack lends itself to bypassing validation functions.
    Imagine if an application encrypts a URL-encoded payload with its application key and gives it to us as way of keeping state.
    The developer assumes we can't modify the ciphertext without corrupting the string, so they trust the ciphertext
    when it's received.

    CBC will XOR the bitshift of the edited cipher block
    with the next blocks. To exploit this structure, we must
    craft a payload in reverse such that it creates our desired string.
    To do this, we need a known plaintext and a desired plaintext.
    We fill the targeted block with the known plaintext.
    We XOR our desired text, 'hiya;admin=true;', with the plaintext to find the "difference".
    Finally, we XOR the difference with the original cipher block.
