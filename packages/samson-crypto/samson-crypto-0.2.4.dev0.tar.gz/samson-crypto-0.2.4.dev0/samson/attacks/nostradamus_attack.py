class NostradamusAttack(object):

    Performs an precomputed multicollision attack.

    The Nostradamus attack is an extension to an iterated-hash multicollision. By precomputing a binary collision tree,
    you can coerce several initial values into a singular final collision. This was used to "predict" the 2008 presidential
    elections. It's highly recommended to use an efficient collision function like an implementation of Wang's attack (Google "Hashclash").
