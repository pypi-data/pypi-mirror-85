Introduction
==============================
Lightweight Rust IDE based on PyQt. (C++ and Python support is experimental)

This IDE is simplified and specialized to competitive programming, user can concentrate on programming and can achieve best performance.

When you open the contest problem page, input and output example of the problem is downloaded automatically in the background.

Then testing with sample cases, debugging with test cases, and submission can be by one click.

Feature
==============================
* Rust / C++ / Python 
* GUI debug
* Online judge testcases downloading and testing. (based on online-judge-tools)
* Debug with online judge testcases
* Do online judge submission
* Completer and jumper (based on racer) 
* Auto Formatting (based on rustfmt)
* Rust REPL (based on evcxr_repl)
* Live Templates (IntelliJ style)
* Contest Task Browsing
* Display graph structure

Software Requirements
==============================
* Linux OS (I only tested with Ubuntu 16.04 / 18.04)
* Python (3.5 or later)

If you want to develop with rust-lang, you need
* evcxr_repl (`cargo install evcxr_repl`)
* rustfmt(`rustup component add rustfmt`)
* racer(Please see https://github.com/racer-rust/racer)

If you want to develop with C++, you need
* clang (8.0.0 or later)
* clang-format
* g++

If you want to develop with Python 3.x, you need
* jedi (`pip install jedi`)
* autopep8 (`pip install autopep8`)

You can browse contest task by Browser Widget.
You can hide (or show) browser, press F11 key.
If page URL is contest task page, contest task is downloaded automatically by online-judge-tools.

Login to Programming Contest
==============================

Some online-judge-tools features (ex. submit) needs login session information.

You can login by
1) Login with Browser Widget
2) Tool bar -> Contest -> Login

<a name="policy">Cookie and Security Policy</a>
==============================

Rujaion only use cookies for programming contest pages which is supported by [online-judge-tools](https://github.com/kmyk/online-judge-tools).

Though you can access any page by browser widget, cookies in other page will not be handled in rujaion explicitly. (QtWebEngine may use it.)

Cookies are only used for online-judge-tools features that require login. (Excepts QtWebEngine inner use.)

We are not liable for damages arising from any user with using rujaion.

Display Graph (Powered by Graph x Graph)
==============================

In contest, you often draw graph structure.

Select graph elements and do "View Graph" in browser right click menu, you can draw graph structure easily.

Display Table
==============================

In contest, you often want to display table data. (ex. Debugging DP table.)

Select graph elements and do "Visualize Table" in console right click menu, you can draw table data.
