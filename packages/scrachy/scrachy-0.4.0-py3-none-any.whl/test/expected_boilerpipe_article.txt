Learn Kubernetes Basics
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for
automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and
discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production
workloads at Google , combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
Planet Scale
Designed on the same principles that allows Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes
can scale without increasing your ops team.
Never Outgrow
Whether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to
deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.
Run Anywhere
Kubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public
cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.
