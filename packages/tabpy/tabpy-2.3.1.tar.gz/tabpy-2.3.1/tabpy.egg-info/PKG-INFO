        # Changelog
        
        ## v2.3.1
        
        ### Bug fixes
        
        - Overriding deployed models.
        
        ## v2.3.0
        
        ### Improvements
        
        - Fixed scrutinizer test run failure.
        
        ## v2.2.0
        
        ### Breaking changes
        
        - TabPy fails with 400 when it is not configure for authentication
          but credentials are provided by client.
        
        ### Bug fixes
        
        - When TabPy is running with no console attached it is not failing
          with 500 when trying to respond with 401 status.
        - tabpy.query() failing when auth is configured.
        
        ### Improvements
        
        - Minor code cleanup.
        
        ## v1.1.0
        
        ### Improvements
        
        - Authorization is now required for the /info API method.
          This method did not check authentication previously. This change is
          backwards compatible with Tableau clients.
        - Improved config parsing flexibility. Previously the
          TABPY_EVALUATE_TIMEOUT setting would be set to a default if
          tabpy couldn't parse the value. Now it will throw an exception
          at startup.
        
        ## v1.0.0
        
        ### Improvements
