# pyckup

Tools to provide easy access to prepared data to data scientists that can't 
be asked.

They just want to get on with the fun -- **not** get stuck in data access and 
data preparation concerns. And they should want that!

Of course, someone needed to do the work of getting the data from where and how it is, 
to where and how it needs to be (for a particular problem and context). 

What we believe is that this work should not only be less tedious and less time 
consuming (see py2store and related for that!), but also, once it's done, 
it shouldn't have to be re-done every time some one wants to kick the data 
around. 

So we made pyckup. 

We hope it helps.
