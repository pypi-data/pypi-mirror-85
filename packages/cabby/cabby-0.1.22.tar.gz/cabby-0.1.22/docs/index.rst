Cabby is designed from the ground up to act as a Python library and as a command line tool, it's key features are:

* **Rich feature set**:
  supports all TAXII services according to TAXII specification (v1.0 and v1.1).

* **Version agnostic**:
  abstracts specific implementation details and returns version agnostic entities.

* **Stream parsing**:
  heavy TAXII Poll Response messages are parsed on the fly, reducing memory footprint and time until first content block is available.
