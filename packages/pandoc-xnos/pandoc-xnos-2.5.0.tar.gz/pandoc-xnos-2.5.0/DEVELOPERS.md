Developer Notes
===============

Branches
--------

The next release is developed in the `nextrelease` branch.  When ready, the changes are merged into the `master` branch.

A copy of the 1.x release series is maintained in the 1.x branch.


Install Alternatives
--------------------

There are a few different options for installing from source:
    
1) To install from the github `master` branch use:

       pip install git+https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-xnos.git --user

   (to upgrade append the `--upgrade` flag).

2) To install from the `nextrelease` branch on github, use

       pip install git+https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-xnos.git@nextrelease --user

   (to upgrade use the --upgrade flag).

3) To install from a local source distribution, `cd` into its root
   and use

       pip install -e . --user

   Note that any changes made to the source will be automatically
   reflected when a filter is run (which is useful for development).


Testing
-------

Unit tests for pandoc-xnos are provided in `test/`.  Integration tests are in `test/integration`.
