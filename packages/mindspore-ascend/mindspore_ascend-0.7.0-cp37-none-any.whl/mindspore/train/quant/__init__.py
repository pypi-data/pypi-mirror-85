Quantization.

User can use quantization aware to train a model. MindSpore supports quantization aware training,
which models quantization errors in both the forward and backward passes using fake-quantization
operations. Note that the entire computation is carried out in floating point. At the end of quantization
aware training, MindSpore provides conversion functions to convert the trained model into lower precision.
