## Gormanian Calendar Calculator

### What is it?

Put simply, it is a library to calculate an alternative date structure based on the comedic sketch of [Dave Gorman](http://davegorman.com/).  In an episode of '*Modern Life is Goodish*', Dave Gorman proposed a new calendar format to replace the existing Gregorian calendar.  In particular, he takes umbridge at the fact that the length of a month varies, when all other units of time are fixed and identical.

You can watch the video in question [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vunESk53r5U&feature=youtu.be) on Dave Gorman's official YouTube channel.

### But why?

Why not?  I happen to agree with the calendar, and decided to write this for a laugh.
