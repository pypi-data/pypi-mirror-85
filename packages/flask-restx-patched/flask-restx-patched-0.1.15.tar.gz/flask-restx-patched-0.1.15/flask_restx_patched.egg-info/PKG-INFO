Description: Flask RestX Patched
        ======================
        
        Extends `Flask-Restx <https://github.com/python-restx/flask-restx>`_ so it can handle `Marshmallow <https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow>`_ schemas and `Webargs <https://github.com/sloria/webargs>`_ arguments.
        
        This is a forked version of a package which does the same thing but for Flask-RestPlus.
        
        The code here is copied directly from the ``flask_restplus_patched`` directory in `Flask-RestPlus Server Example <https://github.com/frol/flask-restplus-server-example>`_. It's easier to use as a dependency in other projects, if it exists in its own repo and is available on PyPI, rather than needing to be copied manually from there.
