              DEVELOPER PREVIEW! There is no official support, do not use in production or any other important clusters.
              The operator affects worker nodes and can cause instability or service disruption.
      
              Performance Addon Operator provides the ability to enable advanced node performance tunings on a set of nodes.

                          workloads have to explicitly assign each thread to a specific
                          cpu in order to work across multiple CPUs. Setting this to "true"
                          allows workloads to be balanced across CPUs. Setting this to "false"

                      values will be set on the node by the performance-addon-operator.
                      It is important to notice that setting hugepages default size to 1G
                      will remove all 2M related folders from the node and it will be impossible
                      to configure 2M hugepages under the node.
