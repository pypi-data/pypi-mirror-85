Description: This repo is designed to manage the library functions used                       for DataMining through mdf data files using the DataSpy                       product made by Intrepid Control System. The library                       contains a bunch of File I/O functions in a dll that                       allow users to parse through mdf data files using their                       own applications like Python, Excel, Matlab, C# etc.                       This library of functions is duplicated on Intrepids                       wireless data server (Wireless NeoVI) allowing users to                       develop scripts on their PC and then run those scripts                       on the Wireless Neo VI data server without requiring                       the data to be downloaded.
