        **a Python module for operating on binary extension fields, GF(2^m)**
        
        Provides classes for creating and operating in finite fields:
        
        *class* ff: general finite field, generates and stores tables for translating between power and vector representations in GF(2^m)
          
          Also provides method for printing out table of minimum polynomials, in same format as Lin and Costello book
        
        *class* ffelt: general finite field element, can be used to carry out arithmetic on the field
        
          Also provides methods to find conjugates, minimum polynomials, and to output vector representations
          
        
Keywords: finite fields binary extension galois minimal polynomials conjugates arithmetic
