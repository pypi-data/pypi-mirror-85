        > This library is in very early stages of development, as such, and in correspondence with a `0.x` semantic major version line, its `API` is
        > likely to rapidly change in breaking ways. It is therefore not recommended to use library for production workloads.
        
        **cdk8s+** is a software development framework that provides high level abstractions for authoring Kubernetes applications.
        Built on top of the auto generated building blocks provided by [cdk8s](../cdk8s), this library includes a hand crafted *construct*
        for each native kubernetes object, exposing richer API's with reduced complexity.
