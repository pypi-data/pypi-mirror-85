		<p>Note that if the custom profile extends beyond the model, it will be truncated. However, in the event a picture is loaded, the original coordinates are assumed to belong to the picture and will be assigned to it appropriately, resulting in a truncation of the image in the model.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Get coordinates from last profile - Convenience function used to auto fill coordinates.</li>
			<li>Load Picture (optional) - An optional picture importer.</li>
		</ul>
