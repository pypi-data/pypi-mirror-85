Description: # Color and Style Cycler
        
        Colors and style cycler
        
        Can cycle through combination of colors and line or marker styles. Colors will be computed from a color gradient,
        depending on the number of lines to plot, which is given as an argument at object creation, and the number of
        styles. By default, styles are supposed to be linestyles. This can be changed to marker with the 'style' argument.
