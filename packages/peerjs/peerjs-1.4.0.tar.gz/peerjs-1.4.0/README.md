# peerjs-python

Python port of [PeerJS](https://github.com/peers) client. 
  - Tracked in issue [#160](https://github.com/peers/peerjs/issues/610) of the official PeerJS project.

Enables [Progressive Web Apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) to discover and pair directly with Python apps using secure, browser supported [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) protocol. 

## Additional features:

- *HTTP Proxy* over WebRTC data channel. It allows PeerJS browser clients to make remote REST requests over WebRTC to a local REST API running behind a firewall.
- *Plug-and-play* functionality that allows seamless Airdrop-like pairing between peers running on the same local network.

See Ambianic UI [PNP module](https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-ui/blob/master/src/store/pnp.js) for a real-world example how PeerJS Python is used with PnP and HTTP Proxy.

## Dependencies

Uses [aiortc](https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc) as Python WebRTC provider. This requires installing a few native dependencies for audio/video media processing.

On Debian/Ubuntu run:
```
apt install libavdevice-dev libavfilter-dev libopus-dev libvpx-dev pkg-config libsrtp2-dev
```
On OS X run:
```
brew install ffmpeg opus libvpx pkg-config
```

## Motivation

This project was originally motivated while searching for a way to: 
-  Connect a Progressive Web App ([Ambianic UI](https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-ui)) directly and securely to an edge device ([Ambianic Edge](https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-edge)) running Python app on a Raspberry Pi behind a home Internet router. 

Other key requirements:
-  Easy Airdrop-like plug and play discovery and pairing between web app and edge devices. 
-  Direct peer-to-peer connectivity to minimize:
    - latency
    - architecture complexity
    - costs associated with traffic and hosting of tunneling servers
    - exposure to public server security attacks
-  Support for:
    - Secure connections
    - Bi-directional data-channel
    - Low latency audio/video media streaming
    - Bi-directional live audio/video media
-  Rely only on [standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/) broadly supported web browser features.
    -  Stable mobile device support (iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi)
    -  Stable desktop OS support (Windows, Mac OS, Linux)
    -  No need for browser plug-ins
-  No intermediary cloud service providers to store and sync user data. 
-  No tedious and complicated NAT setups of dynamic DNS with SSH tunnels between public IP servers and edge devices behind firewall.
-  High throughput and scalability via lightweight signaling service without a persistence layer.

## Project Status

Initial working prototype completed. PeerJS Python is now able to connect over WebRTC DataChannel to PeerJS in the browser and exchange messages.

-  [x] Complete and test connectivity with signaling server (peerjs-server).
-  [x] Complete and test data channel connectivity with web app peers.
-  [x] Release initial version to PyPi.
-  [ ] >90% code coverage with CI tests.
-  [ ] Port media support.
