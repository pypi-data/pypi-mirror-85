Description: TOPSIS implementation for Multi criteria decision making
        
        The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a multi-criteria decision analysis method, which is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS)[4] and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS).
        
        The package (TOPSIS-RONAK-101803137) contains the python script topsis.py and it further contains the function topsis_score which has to given 4 parameters -
        
        1. Name of input .csv file.
        2. Weights of all the attributes in the form of list.
        3. Impact of all the parameters(either '+' or '-').
        4. Name of output .csv file.
        
        Note - All the column entries should be numeric only.
        
        Example code :
        
        import TOPSIS-RONAK-101803137.topsis
        topsis.topsis('inputFile.csv', [1,1,1,1], ['+','+','-','+',],'outputFile.csv')
