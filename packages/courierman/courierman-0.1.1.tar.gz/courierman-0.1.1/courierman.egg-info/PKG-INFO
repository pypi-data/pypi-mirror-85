Description: # Courier Man
        
        I've started this because I was unable to find a working library for handling postman collections inside Python code.
        
        The main objetive of this project is, given a Json exported from a postman library, the hability to load it, find requests, change any field and execute it through the requests library.
        
        ## Name
        
        Since all common names were taken, I took a similar word to post: courier, which surely is not related to HTTP Post. Hopefully the name will not create so much confusion.
