<h1>Movemeter</h1>
A motion analysis tool that (at the moment) mainly just wraps the cv2.matchTemplate function from OpenCV.


<h2>Installing</h2>

The latest version from PyPi can be installed with the command

```
pip install movemeter
```


<h2>How to use</h2>

To open the yet unfinished graphical user interface (GUI)

```python
import movemeter.tk_meter as tkmeter
tkmeter.main()
```
