# Hover

`Hover` is a machine learning helper library that enables smooth human supervision. In other words, it's an interface where you hover over and label your data.. differently. Think driving a hovercraft compared with being on foot.

Hover caters to a variety of programming backgrounds: the "vanilla" use case should be friendly to a Python/Pandas beginner, and there are optional but powerful functionalities to pick up.
