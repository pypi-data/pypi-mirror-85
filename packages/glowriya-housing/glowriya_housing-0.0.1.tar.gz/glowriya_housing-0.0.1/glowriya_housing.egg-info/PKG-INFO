Description: Predicts Median housing value
        
        The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 
        
        The following techniques have been used: 
        
         - Linear regression
         - Decision Tree
         - Random Forest
        
        Steps performed
         - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
         - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
         - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
         - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.
