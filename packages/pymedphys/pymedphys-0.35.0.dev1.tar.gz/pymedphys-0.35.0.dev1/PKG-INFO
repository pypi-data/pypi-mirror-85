What is PyMedPhys?
------------------

An open-source Medical Physics python library with a focus on being
a place to share, review, improve, and transparently learn off of each
other's code. It is inspired by the collaborative work of our physics peers
in astronomy and their `Astropy Project`_. PyMedPhys is available on `PyPI`_
and `GitHub`_.

.. _`Astropy Project`: http://www.astropy.org/
.. _`PyPI`: https://pypi.org/project/pymedphys/
.. _`GitHub`: https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys


Mailing list
------------

If you would like to dive into the community a great place to get started is
to sign up to `the mailing list`_ and say hi by introducing yourself with
where you're from, and what you hope to achieve with PyMedPhys.

Table of contents
-----------------

`Tutorials`_
........................

Get started with a hands-on introduction to PyMedPhys for beginners

`How-To guides`_
........................

Guides and recipes for common problems and tasks

`Reference`_
............................

Technical reference for the `library`_ (modules, functions and classes),
as well as the available `command line tools`_.

`Background`_
..............................

Explanation and discussion of key topics and concepts


Beta level of development
-------------------------

PyMedPhys is currently within the ``beta`` stage of its life-cycle. It will
stay in this stage until the version number leaves ``0.x.x`` and enters
``1.x.x``. While PyMedPhys is in ``beta`` stage, **no API is guaranteed to be
stable from one release to the next.** In fact, it is very likely that the
entire API will change multiple times before a ``1.0.0`` release. In practice,
this means that upgrading ``pymedphys`` to a new version will possibly break
any code that was using the old version of pymedphys. We try to be abreast of
this by providing details of any breaking changes from one release to the next
within the `Release Notes`_.
