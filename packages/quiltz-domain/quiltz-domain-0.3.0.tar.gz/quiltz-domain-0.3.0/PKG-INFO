        * **quiltz-domain** (this package) contains domain level modules like, entity
          id's, results, an email anonymizer, validators and parsers
        * [**quiltz-testsupport**](https://github.com/qwaneu/quiltz-testsupport) contains test support modules, that supports mainly non
          unit tests, like integrating with smtp, probing asynchronous results and
          asserting log statements
        * [**quiltz-messaging**](https://github.com/qwaneu/quiltz-messaging) contains a
          messaging domain concept and an engines to send the messages. Currently only
          smtp sending is supported.
